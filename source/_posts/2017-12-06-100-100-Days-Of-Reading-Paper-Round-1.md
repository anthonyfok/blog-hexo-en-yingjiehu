The supporting project is [100 Days Of Code Round 1 (R, data analysis)](100-Days-Of-Code-Round-1-R-data-analysis)

Main Commitment: I will make projects to develope front-end develoment skill.

Start Date: 2017-12-07
<!-- more -->

## Rules

1. I will code to make projects from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) for at least an hour every day.
2. I will tweet my progress every day, with the hashtag `#100DaysOfCode` and note which day of the challenge I’m on.
3. I will track my progress here and push to GitHub.
4. My daily job is not related to front-end development. All time spent on working on web development will count towards the challenge.
7. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days.

## Some important additional considerations

* Don't skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks.

## LOG
### Day 1: 2017-12-06 Wednesday 
**Link**: [Github Repo](https://github.com/huyingjie/tribute-zhugeliang) | [Website](http://zhugeliang.yingjiehu.com/)

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**: 

* finished the first project "Build a Tribute Page".


**Thoughts and Emotions:**

I finished the tutorials of Bootstrap and jQuery. After that, I started the first project "Build a Tribute Page".

Zhuge Liang is a historical figure that I admire. I feel excited to make a tribute page to him.

Today is the first time I use Bootstrap though I heard it a lot in the past. This tool is awesome. 

It's an intense work. Luckily, all questions along the way were solved by myself. It took around 3 hours.

### Day 2: 2017-12-07 Thursday
**Link**: [Github Repo](https://github.com/huyingjie/projects-page) | [Website](http://projects.yingjiehu.com/)

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**: 

* Started the second project "Personal Portfolio".
* Worked on toggle button and `scrollspy` for at least 4 hours. Finally solved. Thank `@keller0` Cai and `@meitounaoqiao` 殷蔚乔 for help in [FreeCodeCamp/chinese](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/chinese).

**Thoughts and Emotions:**
I already have had a personal website, and my daily job is not website development. But I want to have a fancy project page. 

My purpose to do the "Personal Protolio" project is to list my projects in all fields I am interested in, such as data science, web development. In the future, the list of fields will increase. The project page is ready for it.

Today is a tough day. "Personal Portfolio" is a difficult project. I spent several hours in navigation which uses `scrollspy` and toggle button. There are some differences in `scrollspy` between Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap 4. 

I felt discouraged and wasted time. Then I decided to seek help online. This is a right decision. 

[FreeCodeCamp/chinese](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/chinese) is the channel most suitable for me.
