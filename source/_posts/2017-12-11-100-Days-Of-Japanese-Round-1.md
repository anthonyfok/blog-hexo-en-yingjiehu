Main Commitment: I will recite Japanese words with Anki to increase Japanese vocabulary.

Start Date: 2017-12-10

## Background

I learned Japanese once per week for one semester at a night school around 10 years ago in China. 

I started learning Japanese this July. One day my friend asked me out to have lunch. During the meal, she said her Japanese first class of a session would begin at night. I was curious about how Americans learned Japanese, then audited the class. I was impressed by the teacher's experience. Her native language is Chinese, the same with me. She had been lived in Japanese for 10 years and spoke English so fluently that American employees in the night school did not recognize that she was a foreigner. She is a talented and easy-going person. I enjoyed the class and decided to register one session. Each session has 10 classes, one class per week. I already finished one session with her and currently am taking the second session. 

Since August, I have been using Anki to recite Japanese words. Hence, the 100-day challenge should be easy for me. 

## Rules

1. I will review at least 100 Japanese cards in Anki every day. The words are from [Genki books](http://links.yingjiehu.com/GenkiI2ndedtextbook) and core 10k words. One word has more than 5 cards. One hundred cards are not equal to 100 unique words.
2. I will tweet my progress every day, with the hashtag `#100DaysOfJapanese` and note which day of the challenge I’m on.
3. I will encourage and support at least two people each day in the `#Anki #Japanese` challenge on Twitter. I can read at most 5 tweets about `#Anki #Japanese` each day. Less is more. Don't spend more than enough time on the social networking website.

	3 Options
	
	* Like tweets
	* Leave a comment
4. I will track my progress here and push to GitHub.
5. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days.


## Some important additional considerations

* Don't skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks.

### Day 1: 2017-12-10 
**No. of Anki Cards**: 292

**Time spent**: 34 minutes

**Thoughts and Emotions:**

I cannot concentrate on review Anki cards. A probable reason is a worry about whether I can get positive feedback. 

There are only 4 tweets under `#100DaysOfJapanese`. Too few people. Then I searched weibo, which is Chinese version counterpart of Twitter. People there either posted a picture to show their completion without showing process or stopped within 30 days.

It is a little bit discouraging. I am not sure whether I should incorporate social media during the challenge.

### Day 2: 2017-12-11
**No. of Anki Cards**: 313

**Time spent**: 36 minutes

**Thoughts and Emotions:**

I am happy that I found the community in the twitter. `#100DaysOfJapanese` is not a right hashtag. People use `#Anki #Japanese` to indicate they use Anki to learn Japanese.

### Day 3: 2017-12-12
**No. of Anki Cards**: 525

**Time spent**: 62 minutes

**Thoughts and Emotions:**

There are over 600 cards in the backlog. In recent days, I focus on reviewing old cards; no new cards.
