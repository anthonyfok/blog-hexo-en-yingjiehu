Main Commitment: I will practice makeup. 

Start Date: 2017-12-31


<!-- more -->

This is a very personal project. Making up is a required skill for women. I thought it was a waste of time and worried about the harmful integridents in makeups. Despite my negative emotion towards makeup, I have to think about one method to push myself to learn it. This is the inspiration of the challenge. 

"100 Days of Challenge" can be extended to any skill that you do not enjoy but is required to be learned. 

## Rules
1. I will try to practice makeup once per day. 
2. I will track my progress here and push to GitHub.
3. Watching makeup tutorials will not count towards the challenge.
5. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I wonâ€™t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days.

## Some important additional considerations

* Don't skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks.

## Milestones

1. 1 Day ([Day 1: 2017-12-31 Sunday](#Day-1-2017-12-31-Sunday))
2. 7 Days
3. 30 Days
4. 60 Days
5. 90 Days
6. 100 Days

## LOG
### Day 1: 2017-12-31 Sunday 

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**: 

* Practice based on [Makeup for acne skin (Chinese)](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av11757660/)

My skin color is darker than the host and I have dark circles. The eye color she used does not have an effect on my skin.

**Thoughts and Emotions:**

* I like the tutorial [Makeup for acne skin (Chinese)](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av11757660/) very much. Because it is suitable for acne skin. Most of the hosts have good skin (or they adjust color) and do not emphasize on how to conceal red spots.

My roommate said the foundation is much lighter than my skin. I will try different foundation tomorrow.

**Tomorrow's plan**

* [x]Try a different foundation

<hr>

### Day 2: 2018-01-01 Monday

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**: 

I made up before going out. 

**Thoughts and Emotions:**

I applied both the new foundation and old foundation. I looked whiter. Tomorrow, the only new foundation will be used.

**Tomorrow's plan**

* [x]Use the new foundation only

<hr>

### Day 3: 2018-01-02 Tuesday

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**: 

I used the foundation stick only. It does not cover dark spot well. 

**Thoughts and Emotions:**

I am not sure whether the foundation stick not well or my technique is not good. I got the foundation sticks from Clinique's Black Friday sales one month ago. There is no foundation stick from other brand as a control group. 

**Tomorrow's plan**

* [ ]Concealer with liquid lighter foundation + Foundation Stick
