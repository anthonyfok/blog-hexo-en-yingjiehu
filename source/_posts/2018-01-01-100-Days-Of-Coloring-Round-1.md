Main Commitment: I will practice coloring. 

Start Date: 2018-01-01


<!-- more -->

Coloring is important for designing a website and visualizing data. 

I bought a [color me weekly desk pad](http://links.yingjiehu.com/ColorMeWeeklyDeskPad) today. There are 52 pages inside.

## Rules
1. I will try to color once per day. 
2. I will track my progress here and push to GitHub.
3. Watching coloring tutorials will not count towards the challenge.
5. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I wonâ€™t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days.

## Some important additional considerations

* Don't skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks.

## Milestones

1. 1 Day 1 ([2018-01-01 Monday](#Day-1-2018-01-01-Monday))
2. 7 Days
3. 30 Days
4. 52 Days

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**: 

* Colored one page using triadic color scheme: purple+orange+green
	* Purple is the main color.

**Thoughts and Emotions:**

I decided to practice triadic color system for two days. Today is the second day. 

I do not like to use orange and green together and dislike the combination of today's three colors: purple, green, and orange.

To my surprise, colors of the final graph are harmony and comfortab,le to view.

**Tomorrow's plan**

* [x]Compound Color Scheme

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**: 

* Compound Color Scheme

	* 3 purples
	* 2 yellows

**Thoughts and Emotions:**

I do not like rightmost yellow. All other colors are vivid. The darker yellow makes the whole picture balanced.

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**: 

* Compound Color Scheme
	* 1 pink
	* 1 red

**Thoughts and Emotions:**

I did not like the output today. My roommate liked it, then I thought it was nice. This can show how people like different color scheme and how they affected each other's choice. ðŸ˜‚

**Tomorrow's plan**

**Future plan**

* [ ]Combine color schemes with black and white
