Main Commitment: I will practice coloring. 

Start Date: 2018-01-01


<!-- more -->

Coloring is important for designing a website and visualizing data. 

I bought a [color me weekly desk pad](http://links.yingjiehu.com/ColorMeWeeklyDeskPad) today. There are 52 pages inside. Though the number of pages is not 100, I will categorize it as a 100 Days Challenge.

## Rules
1. I will try to color once per day. 
2. I will track my progress here and push to GitHub.
3. Watching coloring tutorials will not count towards the challenge.
5. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I wonâ€™t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days.

## Some important additional considerations

* Don't skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks.

## Milestones

1. 1 Day 1 ([2018-01-01 Monday](#Day-1-2018-01-01-Monday))
2. 7 Days
3. 30 Days
4. 52 Days
