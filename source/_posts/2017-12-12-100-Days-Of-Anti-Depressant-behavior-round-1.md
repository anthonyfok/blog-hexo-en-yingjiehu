Main Commitment: I will decide to do/not to do things based on behavioral activation for depression. 

Start Date: 2017-12-12

The goal is to be in control.

<!-- more -->

The challenge is very personal and very important for me.

I asked several therapists before about whether I had depression or not and none of them gave me a direct answer.

Finally, a therapist who uses CBT told me that I had depression and my symptom was typical. I felt relieved and can focus on how to treat depression. When I did not get confirmed the answer, I felt frustrated and did not know the goal of the therapy and the criteria for recovery.

The method was taught by the CBT therapist. The goal is to be in control. Before I decide to do/do not do things, I will ask myself whether they will increase depression after doing them. If they decrease depression or keep the depression level the same with before, they can be done.

The method is easily incorporated into my thinking style but it is not a habit. The goal of making the challenge is to make it a habit. Changing thinking style is very different from skills like coding, drawing, reading paper. Then the rules will be different.

## Rules
1. I will try to use it when I make decision on the project level. 
2. I will track my progress here and push to GitHub.
3. Whether I use it or not, I must record here.

### Day 4: 2018-01-01 Monday

I resumed recording anti-depressant behavior activation for depression. Though the method is close to my thinking style, I do not use it automatically so far. I want to develope this skill.

* Morning: 
	* When I lay on the bed this morning, getting up became a difficult thing. I told myself I would regret. 

* Afternoon:
	* I did not use the anti-depressant behavior activation as a rule to do things. I did recall my action of lying on the bed and thought about the it.
* Evening: 

	* The same with afternoon. 
	* Now it is 9 p.m.. I want to relax and told myself I would increase depression tomorrow if I did it.

### Day 5: 2018-01-02 Tuesday

* Rewrote the post to fit 100 Days of Chanllenge style.

**Time, Events, Thoughts and Emotions:**

* Morning
	* The same with yesterday. The temperature was cold and I did not want to get up. Even if I used the method, the anti-dpressant behavior activation does not help. 

		I used the remote to open my small heater. I got up even if I knew it was still cold outside and the heater would not warm the whole room.
* Afternoon
	* Around 3:40 p.m., I felt anxious and wanted to open music as a background noise. I told myself it would increase depression if I did that. Then I opened the Markdown file of the challenge and started writing introduction, rules, and goals, and formatting the challenge.  
* Evening
