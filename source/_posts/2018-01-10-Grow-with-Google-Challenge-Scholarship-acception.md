The reception letter was in the Gmail inbox. I did not open it until 11 p.m.. It made my day! This month (or from the beginning of 2018), two things made me happy. 😆

1. [Awesome Checklist Checklist](https://github.com/huyingjie/Checklist-Checklist) project got [over 1500 stars](http://yingjiehu.com/awesome-checklist-checklist/). (2018-01-08)

2. I got acceptation letter from Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship. (2018-01-10)

I did not expect that Udacity would give me scholarship because they rejected me once in the middle of last year (2017). Google sponsored `Women Techmakers Udacity Scholarship` whose deadline was June 9, 2017. I encouraged my roommate to apply for the scholarship. Both of us were rejected. 😢

It never hurts to try applying again. It is my day! 🌈☀️
