## Rules

1. I will read paper for at least an hour every day.
2. I will tweet my progress every day, with the hashtag `#100DaysOfReadingPaper` and note which day of the challenge I’m on.
3. I will track my progress here and push to GitHub.
4. If I read as part of my job, I will count that time towards the challenge.
7. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days.

## Some important additional considerations

* Don't skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks.
