Main Commitment: I will make projects to develope front-end develoment skill.

Start Date: 2017-12-07

<!-- more -->

## Rules

1. I will code to make projects from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) for at least an hour every day.
2. I will tweet my progress every day, with the hashtag `#100DaysOfCode #freecodecamp` and note which day of the challenge I’m on.
3. I will track my progress here and push to GitHub.
4. My daily job is not related to front-end development. All time spent on working on web development will count towards the challenge.
5. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days.
5. I will encourage and support at least two people each day in the `#100DaysOfCode #freecodecamp ` challenge on Twitter. I can read at most 5 tweets about `#100DaysOfCode #freecodecamp` each day. Less is more. Don't spend more than enough time on the social networking website.

	3 Options
	
	* Like tweets
	* Leave a comment
	* (optional) Looking at their projects and giving them feedback (no more than 10 minutes per day)

## Some important additional considerations

* Don't skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks.

## LOG
### Day 1: 2017-12-06 Wednesday 
**Link**: [Github Repo](https://github.com/huyingjie/tribute-zhugeliang) | [Project 1: Tribue](http://zhugeliang.yingjiehu.com/)

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**: 

* finished the first project "Build a Tribute Page".


**Thoughts and Emotions:**

I finished the tutorials of Bootstrap and jQuery. After that, I started the first project "Build a Tribute Page".

Zhuge Liang is a historical figure that I admire. I feel excited to make a tribute page to him.

Today is the first time I use Bootstrap though I heard it a lot in the past. This tool is awesome. 

It's an intense work. Luckily, all questions along the way were solved by myself. It took around 3 hours.

### Day 2: 2017-12-07 Thursday
**Link**: [Github Repo](https://github.com/huyingjie/projects-page) | [Project 2: Personal Portfolio](http://projects.yingjiehu.com/)

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**: 

* Started the second project "Personal Portfolio".
* Worked on toggle button and `scrollspy` for at least 4 hours. Finally solved. Thank `@keller0` Cai and `@meitounaoqiao` 殷蔚乔 for help in [FreeCodeCamp/chinese](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/chinese).

**Thoughts and Emotions:**
I already have had a personal website, and my daily job is not website development. But I want to have a fancy project page. 

My purpose to do the "Personal Protolio" project is to list my projects in all fields I am interested in, such as data science, web development. In the future, the list of fields will increase. The project page is ready for it.

Today is a tough day. "Personal Portfolio" is a difficult project. I spent several hours in navigation which uses `scrollspy` and toggle button. There are some differences in `scrollspy` between Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap 4. 

I felt discouraged and wasted time. Then I decided to seek help online. This is a right decision. 

[FreeCodeCamp/chinese](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/chinese) is the channel most suitable for me. 

Reference: 

* [Scroll @Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/scrollspy/)

### Day 3: 2017-12-08 Friday
**Link**: [Github Repo](https://github.com/huyingjie/projects-page) | [Project 2: Personal Portfolio](http://projects.yingjiehu.com/)

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**: 

* edit the first section
* add `100-DAY CHALLENGES` section
* change Awesome Font Icon from 4 to 5

**Thoughts and Emotions:**

I am a little bit depressed today. The whole day I searched one content on iPad lying in bed. At night I got up, had dinner, took a shower, and did laundry. And then I started resuming doing the yesterday's work.

Even if I made big progress yesterday, I spent almost all day to work the project. It is very bad. Other important things are pushed away, and this will increase my stress level. The result is that I will burn out more easily and the probability of quitting the 100-day challenge will increase.

I promised myself at around 6 that I would do the project for one hour. To make it work, I set a timer. Sadly, I broke the promise and worked much longer than I promised. It is 3 a.m. now.

Today I almost finished the 2nd project Personal Portfolio except for one problem: collapsable menu. This is [an example from w3 school](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/tryit.asp?filename=trybs_ref_js_scrollspy&stacked=h). When the screen is small, the menu is collapsed. When I open the menu, the menu is overlapped with the content below.

I posted the question in the gitter of FreeCodeCamp. I will go to sleep and hope that the answer will appear tomorrow.

### Day 4: 2017-12-09 Saturday
**Link**: [Github Repo](https://github.com/huyingjie/projects-page) | [Project 2: Personal Portfolio](http://projects.yingjiehu.com/)

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**: 

* changed color scheme
* added jump to top button
* asked yesterday's question in FreeCodeCamp forum because I got no answer in the gitter
* Finished Project 2: Personal Portfolio

**Thoughts and Emotions:**

I started coding at 12 a.m. because I spent a lot of time during the day in freeing up space for Mac Air to install Mac OS High Sierra. 

Initially, I planned to finish project 2 in one hour and spend two hours in fact. The final color scheme of the website still looks strange. After I learn following courses in FreeCodeCamp in the future, I can polish the website. Finishing one not-perfect product is better than a never-finish product.

### Day 5: 2017-12-10 Sunday 
**Link**: [Github Repo](https://github.com/huyingjie/randomquotemachine) | [Project 3: Random Quote Machine](http://randomquotemachine.yingjiehu.com/)

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**: 

* Project 2 "Personal Portfolio" amendment
	* added padding to the right of icons
	* added icons in front of titles of sections
* Started Project 3 "Random Quote Machine"

**Thoughts and Emotions:**

There are lots of JavaScript tutorials before project 3 in freeCodeCamp. If I start projects until finishing tutorials, I will forget much knowledge I have learned so far, and it will be harder to continue 100DaysCoder challenge. I plan to complete `CSS` part of projects and started `Javascript` part until I studied all `JavaScript` tutorials.

Today's plan was 2-hour tutorial and 1-hour coding. Studying tutorials for 2 hours was as planned. However, I spent much more time in coding than one hour. It is hard to start and harder to stop. It happens to all aspects of my life. I do not know how to solve it. Happiness was generated when one-hour coding was completed. Stress increased as time came by after one hour.

I am happy that I found a useful Atom plugin `Auto-live-server` . It refreshed the local webpage when web development related files are saved.

There is one problem I asked in the gitter. 

Button's border style is not consistent with different browsers. Here is my code.

```css
button {
  color: white;
  background-color: pink;
  box-shadow: 0;
  border:none;
}
	
button:focus {
  border:none;
}
	
```

* Chrome has a border around the button after I click it.
* Safari and codepen do not have the border.


**Tomorrow's plan**

* [x]study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge)
* [x]Project 3 Random Quotes Machine
	* [x]move `CSS` to `main.css`
	* [x]rethink how to structure `css` file
	* [x]adjust the width of border of quotes
	* [x]adjust the size of social media icons
* [x]Project 2 Project Portolio
	* [x]look for a picture for Project 2
	* [x]change Project 2 status from `Ongoing` to `Complete`
	* [x]add Project 3 and set it `Ongoing`
	* [x]create a new challenge

<hr>

### Day 6: 2017-12-11 Monday

**Link**: 

* [Github Repo](https://github.com/huyingjie/projects-page) | [Project 2: Personal Portfolio](http://projects.yingjiehu.com/)
* [Github Repo](https://github.com/huyingjie/randomquotemachine) | [Project 3: Random Quote Machine](http://randomquotemachine.yingjiehu.com/)

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**: 

* completed the plan set yesterday!!
* Project 2 Project Portolio

	* [x] move `CSS` to `main.css`
	* [x] move JavaScript to `/scripts`

Styling using pure `CSS` takes a lot of time. Adding a graph is simpler and more beautiful.

**Thoughts and Emotions:**

Before learning in freecodecamp, I thought front-end development incorporated designing websites. I like coding part but not designing. Two parts are knitted together during the process of learning. Projects showing from other students in freecodecamp are more beautiful than my page. This made me feel bad.

It is satisfying to change project status from "ongoing" to "complete" and add new projects to my project portfolio page.

Again, when I started doing projects, it is hard to stop. Now is 12 a.m. 

**Tomorrow's plan**

* [x]study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge)
* [x]Start to do the html part of Project 4: the Local Weather for one hour only. Don't overdo.

### Day 7: 2017-12-12 Tuesday
**Link**: [Github Repo](https://github.com/huyingjie/theLocalWeather) | [Project 4: the Local Weather](http://localweather.yingjiehu.com/)

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**: 

I finished all items on the todo list created  yesterday.

**Thoughts and Emotions:**

It is the 7th day!! I have been doing this challenge for one week. It is the 2nd [milestone](#Milestones) 😃

Though HTML part of [Project 4](http://localweather.yingjiehu.com/) is simpler than that of [Project 3](http://randomquotemachine.yingjiehu.com/), I was amazed that I finished building it in one and half an hour including time of seeking help in gitter. The files of `HTML` and `CSS` are clean, and the logic of codes are clear. I am satisfied with what have been done today.
 
I will start to code `HTML` part of Project 5 tomorrow. The project is cool because of both functionality and design. 

One hour per day is devoted to learning tutorials in FreeCodeCamp. The progress will be slow. I am overwhelmed by the number of lessons needed to learn before I can touch `JavaScript` part of Project 3-5. Basic algorithm scripting based on FreeCodeCamp can require around 50 hours!!!

**Tomorrow's plan**

* [x]Study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge)
* [x]Work on suggestion from gitter
* [ ]Start to do the `HTML` part of Project 5: Build a Wikipedia Viewer for one hour only. Don't overdo.

```
Sorin Ruse @sorinr 22:05
@huyingjie add also in css background-repeat: no-repeat; to the body selector
	
@huyingjie and also background-attachment: fixed; to make the img full width/height even when you resize the screen
	
Sorin Ruse @sorinr 22:12
@huyingjie you may also look into positioning the background and apply the one that fits your needs <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position>

### Day 8: 2017-12-13 Wednesday
**Link**: [Github Repo](https://github.com/huyingjie/projects-page) | [Project 2: Personal Portfolio](http://projects.yingjiehu.com/)

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**: 

* [x]Study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge)
* [x]Work on suggestion from gitter
* [ ]Start to do the `HTML` part of Project 5: Build a Wikipedia Viewer for one hour only. Don't overdo.
* [x]Add Project 4 to [project page](http://projects.yingjiehu.com)

**Thoughts and Emotions:**

The time spent on adding new projects to [project page](http://projects.yingjiehu.com) was longer than I expected. The list of projects is formatted by decks with Bootstrap 4. I feel the design is a little bit uncomfortable but don't know why. At the end of today's task, I asked  [the question in FreeCodeCamp forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/ask-for-styling-advice-of-project-portfolio/163627). 

There is no time to touch project 5 today. It will be tomorrow's task.

Basic algorithm scripting based on FreeCodeCamp can require around 50 hours. This makes me feel nervous. The best way to remove the negative emotion is to have a try. I did one algorithm and learned the format of algorithm scripting. The problems in the section are to use `JavaScript` array methods learned in the last section. Array methods are similar to `Swift` I learned 2 years ago. Even though I forgot the details of `Swift`, familiarity can help me learn counterparts in `JavaScript`.

**Tomorrow's plan**

* [x]Study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge)
* [ ]Start to do the `HTML` part of Project 5: Build a Wikipedia Viewer for one hour only. Don't overdo.
* [x]Read answers in [FreeCodeCamp forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/ask-for-styling-advice-of-project-portfolio/163627). 

### Day 9: 2017-12-14 Thursday 
**Link**: [Github Repo](https://github.com/huyingjie/projects-page) | [Project 2: Personal Portfolio](http://projects.yingjiehu.com/)

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**: 

I read the reply to Personal Portfolio site feedback in [FreeCodeCamp forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/ask-for-styling-advice-of-project-portfolio/163627). 

The reply gave 6 points needed to improve.

* 5 points I solved today
	
	* Make sure the items have a bit of space around them on smaller screens. On a mobile they go right to the edge of the screen, which looks a bit cramped.

		Solution: add `padding: 80px` to `.section`
		```css
		section {
		  border-style: solid;
		  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px;
		  box-shadow: 0px 2px rgb(160,160,160);
		  padding: 80px;
		}
		```
	* Make sure the images align - the ‘Ongoing’ header seems to push the image down a bit further than the ones on completed projects.
	
		Originally, I used `<span class="fa-layers fa-fw fa-2x">`. After deleting `fa-2x`, it became `<span class="fa-layers fa-fw">` and the problem solved.
		
		```html
		<span class="fa-layers fa-fw">
			<div class="fa-3x">
				<i class="fas fa-certificate text-danger"></i>
				<span class="fa-layers-text fa-inverse text-warning" data-fa-transform="shrink-11.5 rotate--30 right-5">NEW</span>
			</div>
		</span>
		```
	* The sections could do with a bit more vertical spacing at the bottom
		Solution: add `padding: 80px` to `.section`
	
		The same with the first one.
		
	* It’s Code not Codes

		Solution: replace `Codes` with `Code`
	* There’s a broken link to style.css

		Solution: delete the link

* 1 point I did not solve

	* On intermediate screen sizes the items get very narrow - maybe reduce the number of items per row sooner

**Thoughts and Emotions:**

Making small adjustments or improvements to the website can take as much time as making one. I spent over 1 hour in correcting Project 2: Personal Portfolio only.

It is a little bit discouraging because I have included starting Project 5 in tomorrow's plan for two days, but there is no time left for this project.

**Tomorrow's plan**

* [x]Study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge)
* [x]Start to do the `HTML` part of Project 5: Build a Wikipedia Viewer for one hour only. Don't overdo.

<hr>

### Day 10: 2017-12-15 Friday  
**Link**: [Github Repo](https://github.com/huyingjie/wikipediaViewer) | [Project 5: A Wikipedia Viewer](http://wikipediaviewer.yingjiehu.com)

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**: 

* Started project 5

**Thoughts and Emotions:**

I finally started Project 5. Among the only 5 projects, this is the first project which uses `jQuery`. I am excited to see the page has animation; if a user clicks the search icon, the search bar will appear and the search icon will disappear. It is fun.  

**Tomorrow's plan**

* [x]Study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge)
* [ ]Project 5: A Wikipedia Viewer
	* [ ]Adjust the style of search bar
	* [ ]Make the search icon and the search bar the same height
	* [x]Change action field to search button
	* [ ]Adjust animation
		* [ ]If search bar is empty, click search button, the search bar will disappear and the search icon will appear.
		* [ ]If search bar is not empty, searching action is activated
* [x]Add footer to Project 3: Random Quote Machine
* [x]Add footer to Project 4: the Local Weather

### Day 11: 2017-12-16 Saturday 
**Link**: [Github Repo](https://github.com/huyingjie/wikipediaViewer) | [Project 5: A Wikipedia Viewer](http://wikipediaviewer.yingjiehu.com)

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**: 
I finished 4 items in yesterday's plan.

frustration:

* alignment of footer
* How a search button is put inside a search text bar?
* How positions of the search button and search text bar are not change when screen size changes?

I will questions tomorrow in gitter.

**Thoughts and Emotions:**

Today is the toughest day. I struggle with several things in my personal life. During the day, I tried putting dynamic graphs generated by `R` package on the blog. There are no `JavaScript` library link and `JavaScript` code block containing data, then I cannot paste them to a Markdown or HTML file. R community including statistics community lacks good documentation and coding quality is poor. My knowledge of R never seems sufficient to find the solution to them. I feel constricted and frustrated all the time.

Yesterday I thought I could finish the `Basic Algorithm Script` today. It is more difficult than I expected.

* If a function has lots of argument without argument name, use `Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 0)` to get all arguments
* `array.slice()`'s second argument is the end index - 1, not the number of characters to be sliced.

I guess writing pseudocode before programming will help.

**Tomorrow's plan**

* [ ]Study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge)
* [ ]Project 5: A Wikipedia Viewer
	* [ ]ask in gitter
		* [ ]alignment of footer
		* [ ]How a search button is put inside a search text bar?
		* [ ]How positions of the search button and search text bar are not change when screen size changes?
	* [ ]Adjust the style of search bar
	* [ ]Make the search icon and the search bar the same height
	* [ ]Adjust animation
		* [ ]If search bar is empty, click search button, the search bar will disappear and the search icon will appear.
		* [ ]If search bar is not empty, searching action is activated

### Day 12: 2017-12-19 Tuesday 
**Link**: [Project 3: Random Quote Machine](http://randomquotemachine.yingjiehu.com/)

**Today's Progress (achievements and frustrations)**: 

* Studied tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge)
Project 3
* Created a JSON file containing ancient Chinese sayings
	1. Generate a random integer to select which sayings to show
	1. Get JSON data from the JSON file
	1. Calculate length of the JSON data
	1. Get the first element of the first element in the JSON data
	
**Thoughts and Emotions:**

* I skipped two days because I prepared a presentation for today's seminar.
* I did not follow the plan created on 2017-12-16 because I finished "Basic Algorithm Scripting" part and started learning "JSON APIs and Ajax". I want to apply the knowledge learned today to today's work.
* I finished 5 things under Project 3 in Today's progress. Each thing requires me searching online. They are not easy tasks for a newbie. Hence, they created a lot of frustration. 

I am a little bit discouraged by the slow process. When I thought of the fact that they were done in 1 hour, it created more hope. 

**Tomorrow's plan**

* [ ]Studied tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge)
* Do Project 3 for 1 hour:
	* Make each element in JSON data appear in HTML
	* Click button to change the quote

If there is time left, 

* Create a JSON file of colors
* Generate random number for colors
* Edit HTML to change color
