When I waked up this morning, I was astonished at the number of stars on GitHub, over 300. This is the first repo I got over 30 stars. I guess this open source project can be considered as a hit.

During the day, I was so excited and checked the statistics several times per hour. 

Around midnight, there are over 500 people who have starred the projects. 

I am satisfied: 500 stars in one day.

## 2017-12-31 Sunday

Awesome Checklist Checklist is ranking No.3 on the GitHub trend today!
