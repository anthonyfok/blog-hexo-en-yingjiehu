Instead, optimize for the total amount of impact over time. Once you’ve gotten the riskiest part out of the way, prioritize working on the part of the project that would result in the highest amount of impact immediately.</p><p>  Here’s one way to think about this: plot the impact of a project over time, where the Y-axis is impact, and the X axis is time. At the start of the project, the impact is 0%, and at the end of the project, the impact is 100%. You want to maximize the area under the curve by doing high ROI tasks first.</p></li><li><p>Try to avoid rewriting big systems from scratch as much as possible. When doing a rewrite, we tend to </p><ol><li>underestimate how much work it would be</li><li>be tempted to add new features and improvements</li><li><p>build an overly complicated system because we are too focused on all the shortcomings of the first system.</p><p>Instead of doing a big rewrite, consider incrementally replacing subsystems. Have good abstraction layers that support swapping out one part of the old system at a time, so you don’t need to wait for everything to be done to test the new system.</p></li></ol></li></ul><h3 id="The-scoping-phase"><a href="#The-scoping-phase" class="headerlink" title="The scoping phase"></a>The scoping phase</h3><ol><li>Divide the project into small tasks, <strong>each taking two days or less</strong>. </li><li>Define measurable milestones to get to the project goal. Schedule each with a specific calendar date representing when you expect this milestone to be reached. Then, establish some sort of external accountability on these milestones by, for example, committing them to your manager and setting up milestone check-ins.</li><li>Think of project time estimates as probability distributions, not best-case scenarios. Instead of telling someone that a feature will be finished in 6 weeks, tell them something like “there’s a 50% likelihood of finishing the feature in 4 weeks, and a 90% chance we’d finish it in 8 weeks.” This tends to force people to be more realistic.</li><li>Add buffer to account for: (1) Dev time != calendar time, due to meetings, interviews, and holidays. I usually multiply the dev time by 1.5 to get to the calendar time. (2) Unexpected project tasks time, since there are always tasks that you didn’t realize you need to do until much later. These tasks could include refactoring old code, debugging strange behaviors, or adding tests. The more experienced you are at scoping, the smaller this multiplier will get.</li><li>Resist the temptation to under-scope. Be honest about how long tasks will take, not how long you or someone else (such as your manager or the Go To Market team) wants them to take.</li><li>Use historical data. Keep track of whether you’ve tended to over scope or under scope projects in the past (most people tend to under scope). Adjust your scoping accordingly.</li><li>Consider timeboxing open-ended parts of the project. Instead of “find the best stream processing framework for this system,” which can take months of research and prototyping, timebox it to “find a suitable streaming processing framework in a week.” Use your judgment here to balance this against incurring long-term operational overhead.</li></ol><h3 id="The-execution-phase"><a href="#The-execution-phase" class="headerlink" title="The execution phase"></a>The execution phase</h3><ul><li><p>Re-scope regularly during the project execution. </p><p>  For each task, track how much time you estimated the task would take, then how long it actually took you to complete it. </p><p>  Do this for every measurable milestone. </p><p>  If your scoping is off by 50% for the first parts of the project, odds are your scoping will also be off by 50% for the rest of the project.</p></li><li><p>Use milestones to answer “how’s the project going?” </p><p>  As engineers, it’s tempting to answer “it’ll be done by next week” or “until end of this month.” But these types of vague answers tend to create projects that are always 2 weeks away from being finished. Instead, use the (re-scoped) milestones to give a concrete answer based on how much work is left.</p></li></ul><h2 id="Template-for-Log"><a href="#Template-for-Log" class="headerlink" title="Template for Log"></a>Template for Log</h2><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">### Day : </span><br><span class="line">**Today&apos;s Progress (achievements and frustrations)**: </span><br><span class="line">**Thoughts and Emotions**</span><br><span class="line">**Github Repo**:</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h2 id="LOG"><a href="#LOG" class="headerlink" title="LOG"></a>LOG</h2><h3 id="Day-1-2017-12-11"><a href="#Day-1-2017-12-11" class="headerlink" title="Day 1: 2017-12-11"></a>Day 1: 2017-12-11</h3><p><strong>Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations)</strong>:<br><strong>Thoughts and Emotions</strong><br><strong>Github Repo</strong>: </p>]]></content:encoded>

        &lt;p&gt;Main Commitment: I will recite Japanese words with Anki to increase Japanese vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Main Commitment: I will recite Japanese words with Anki to increase Japanese vocabulary.</p><p>Start Date: 2017-12-10</p><a id="more"></a><h2 id="Background"><a href="#Background" class="headerlink" title="Background"></a>Background</h2><p>I learned Japanese once per week for one semester at a night school around 10 years ago in China. </p><p>I started learning Japanese this July. One day my friend asked me out to have lunch. During the meal, she said her Japanese first class of a session would begin at night. I was curious about how Americans learned Japanese, then audited the class. I was impressed by the teacher’s experience. Her native language is Chinese, the same with me. She had been lived in Japanese for 10 years and spoke English so fluently that American employees in the night school did not recognize that she was a foreigner. She is a talented and easy-going person. I enjoyed the class and decided to register one session. Each session has 10 classes, one class per week. I already finished one session with her and currently am taking the second session. </p><p>Since August, I have been using Anki to recite Japanese words. Hence, the 100-day challenge should be easy for me. </p><h2 id="Rules"><a href="#Rules" class="headerlink" title="Rules"></a>Rules</h2><ol><li>I will review at least 100 Japanese cards in Anki every day. The words are from <a href="http://links.yingjiehu.com/GenkiI2ndedtextbook" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genki books</a> and core 10k words. One word has more than 5 cards. One hundred cards are not equal to 100 unique words.</li><li>I will tweet my progress every day, with the hashtag <code>#100DaysOfJapanese</code> and note which day of the challenge I’m on.</li><li><p>I will encourage and support at least two people each day in the <code>#Anki #Japanese</code> challenge on Twitter. I can read at most 5 tweets about <code>#Anki #Japanese</code> each day. Less is more. Don’t spend more than enough time on the social networking website.</p><p> 3 Options</p><ul><li>Like tweets</li><li>Leave a comment</li></ul></li><li>I will track my progress here and push to GitHub.</li><li>I will only skip a day if something important comes up.

A probable reason is a worry about whether I can get positive feedback. </p><p>There are only 4 tweets under <code>#100DaysOfJapanese</code>. Too few people. Then I searched weibo, which is Chinese version counterpart of Twitter. People there either posted a picture to show their completion without showing process or stopped within 30 days.</p><p>It is a little bit discouraging. I am not sure whether I should incorporate social media during the challenge.</p><p><hr></p><h3 id="Day-2-2017-12-11-Monday"><a href="#Day-2-2017-12-11-Monday" class="headerlink" title="Day 2: 2017-12-11 Monday"></a>Day 2: 2017-12-11 Monday</h3><p><strong>No. of Anki Cards</strong>: 313</p><p><strong>Time spent</strong>: 36 minutes</p><p><strong>Thoughts and Emotions:</strong></p><p>I am happy that I found the community in the twitter. <code>#100DaysOfJapanese</code> is not a right hashtag.

In the future, the list of fields will increase. The project page is ready for it.</p><p>Today is a tough day. “Personal Portfolio” is a difficult project. I spent several hours in navigation which uses <code>scrollspy</code> and toggle button.

And then I started resuming doing the yesterday’s work.</p><p>Even if I made big progress yesterday, I spent almost all day to work the project. It is very bad. Other important things are pushed away, and this will increase my stress level. The result is that I will burn out more easily and the probability of quitting the 100-day challenge will increase.</p><p>I promised myself at around 6 that I would do the project for one hour. To make it work, I set a timer. Sadly, I broke the promise and worked much longer than I promised. It is 3 a.m. now.</p><p>Today I almost finished the 2nd project Personal Portfolio except for one problem: collapsable menu.

If I start projects until finishing tutorials, I will forget much knowledge I have learned so far, and it will be harder to continue 100DaysCoder challenge. I plan to complete <code>CSS</code> part of projects and started <code>Javascript</code> part until I studied all <code>JavaScript</code> tutorials.</p><p>Today’s plan was 2-hour tutorial and 1-hour coding. Studying tutorials for 2 hours was as planned. However, I spent much more time in coding than one hour. It is hard to start and harder to stop. It happens to all aspects of my life. I do not know how to solve it. Happiness was generated when one-hour coding was completed. Stress increased as time came by after one hour.</p><p>I am happy that I found a useful Atom plugin <code>Auto-live-server</code> .

        &lt;p&gt;I usually saw some tutorials in youtube about how to use softwares. There is a high probability that people in the video used Mac to teach how to program. In the past, I feel doubt that why it happened. Last year, in the thanksgiving’s shopping season ($150 off), I decided to buy 13 inch,  not too big and heavy, not too small. In the store, it was easy for me to confuse which one to buy, Mac Pro or Mac Air. The employee in the NYU Mac store said price performance ratio was better. She recommended that  it was better to buy Mac Air if Mac was my secondary computer. Finally, I made the decision to buy &lt;a title=&quot;Mac pro 13 inch&quot; href=&quot;http://links.yingjiehu.com/Apple13pro&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mac Pro 13 inch&lt;/a&gt; because its CPU was better than Mac Air and storage was bigger.

Finally, I made the decision to buy <a title="Mac pro 13 inch" href="http://links.yingjiehu.com/Apple13pro" target="_blank">Mac Pro 13 inch</a> because its CPU was better than Mac Air and storage was bigger. <a id="more"></a></p><p>Last week, my experience told me that it is one of the most valuable items purchased last year. I did one problem about kernel smoothing method and used guassian kernel. The training data set was big with over 7000 observations and 56 predictors. All the predictors had to be used to generate guassian kernals for each observation in test data. Then I programmed the process to create guassian kernals. For each test data, it took about 3 minutes to generate the wights. I felt it was too slow then run the same program in Lenovo Thinkpad T420. It cost third times time. One of my classmates used Mac Air to program, she could not know when the program would stop but the same program was run in Mac Pro in several seconds. Big difference!</p><p>A computer with faster CPU is very important.</p><p>It recalled me the time last semester. A lot of programming were required for bayesian class. Some programs were slow. If I used Mac Pro at that time, less time would be put in my homework and I did not need to stay up every week!</p>]]></content:encoded>

        &lt;p&gt;How long to write a book? No correct answer to this question. My sensibility always admire people who can write the book as quickly as possible because the speed implies that they have high productivity and other abilities. My intellects know my sensibility is wrong. How to marry intellects and sensibility? I do not have answer to this question, either. One thing can be confirmed that good books take time. How long? Several years.

Several years. <a id="more"></a></p><p><a href="http://blog.ericnovik.com/2013/03/28/getting-ready-to-write-a-book/" target="_blank">Eric Novik planned to write a book recently</a>, 8 chapter and over 300 pages. He asked Prof. Gelman:</p><blockquote>The work seems overwhelming. I always wondered how you manage to produce such high volume of high quality content. What’s the secret?</blockquote><br><a href="http://andrewgelman.com/2013/03/31/hes-getting-ready-to-write-a-book/" target="_blank">Prof. Gelman replied in his blog:</a><br><blockquote>The first secret is, I wouldn’t try to write a book in 6 to 8 months. The first edition of Bayesian Data Analysis took several years. Each new edition took awhile too. So if “long and arduous” to you means “6 to 8 months,” I think your time management skills are already much better than mine!</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>
