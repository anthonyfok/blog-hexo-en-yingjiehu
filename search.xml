I will not memorize any syntax anymore. Every time I want to use something, the tables are the first place to check. Besides, it is convenient to compare different languages. It is tough to memorize syntax if multiple programming languages are used in the same period. For example, all languages have boolean, the most basic variable type. There are two values, true or false. Python: True, False R: TRUE, FALSE JavaScript: true, false You can get it. There are 3 ways to present boolean. My brain is reluctant to memorize which language uses which method. Other examples: How to define a function? Whether variables should be declared before usage? Whether variables types should be written when we create variables Whether there is a keyword to declare a variable? and more If you can memorize details of all programming languages you have learned, you are genius in my eyes.

    <title><![CDATA[100 Days Of Helping Students in Udacity Forum [Dumped]]]></title>
    <url>%2F100-Days-Of-Helping-Students-in-Udacity-Forum%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Main Commitment: I will answer at least 5 questions in Udacity forum for Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship every day. (web development track) Start Date: 2018-01-11 BackgroundI received the acceptance letter of Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship (web development track), Phase I. The scholarship has two phases. The criteria to be selected for Phase II: Complete the course before April 11 Be Active in the Udacity forum or slack I will be committed to completing the course. However, I cannot be active in the forum or any social media channel for a long time because of introversion. I got the following information on #AMA of slack. Q: How are you keeping track of our Slack usage in regards to moving on to the second scholarship? I know you can track our forum posts, but not sure how you can accurately measure Slack usage? A: We’ll be focusing on quality of your contributions and looking for leadership in the community. To be clear, leadership doesn’t just mean being the expert and answering questions. It also means taking the plunge as a beginner, putting yourself out here in the community, and really embracing this as an opportunity to learn and get support. We see that as leadership as well! In terms of Slack, we’re in here every single day participating with you for the next 3 months. We’ll be tracking participation and leadership through a variety of metrics. I hate the idea of “leadership”. I don’t want to be led by anyone. I will be responsible for my own study. How to thrive as an introvert in an extroverted work environment? My solution is to at least answer 5 questions in the forum every day and to record the progress here, then close the browser for the rest of the day. I tend to overdo things. The restriction helps me not consume more energy and time than needed in the social networking websites. We will see people learn faster when reading the forum. It will increase pressure. If we read the forum every day for a long time, the pressure will accumulate little by little until defeating us. Restricting the access to the forum will keep the stress level to be manageable. If I finish the course, complete the challenge, and do not receive the Phase II scholarship in the end, I will not blame myself for not working harder. Updates: Projects will not be graded. But this is my goal of learning. I am considering whether I should work hard for round 2. Rules I will answer at least 5 questions in Udacity forum for Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship. (web development track) every day I will track my progress here and push to GitHub. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days. The most important goal is to complete the course. Less is more. Don’t spend more than enough time on the social networking website (forum, slack, and Twitter). Some important additional considerations Don’t skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks.

Q: Hi everyone, this is probably a silly question but when I type&lt; button&gt; Click Me! &lt; /button&gt; (I did it without spaces and it worked for my quiz but not on the browser, I just don’t know how to paste as plain text here. Sorry!) into my browser it does not actually show me a button. I feel like I am missing something in the beginning but I don’t know what it is. Can anyone help? A: How about using different browsers? It is good to install multiple browsers on the computer. Then you will know which one has the error, code or browser specific3.4.5. Thoughts and Emotions: Tomorrow’s plan DumpedThis is the first 100-Day challenge I gave up. The expected time to be spent on the Udacity forum and slack will be enormous to be enrolled in the Round 2 scholarship. I dislike spending time this way. It means I give up pursing Round 2 scholarship. Thanks to my roommate. She helped me make the decision. It is tough to give up.]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship Acceptance Letter]]></title>
    <url>%2FGrow-with-Google-Challenge-Scholarship-Acceptance-letter%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[ Log2018-01-10 WednesdayThe acceptance letter was in the Gmail inbox. I did not open it until 11 p.m.. It made my day! This month (or from the beginning of 2018), two things made me happy. 😆 Awesome Checklist Checklist project got over 1500 stars. (2018-01-08) I got the acceptance letter from Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship. (2018-01-10) I did not expect that Udacity would give me scholarship because they rejected me once in the middle of last year (2017). Google sponsored Women Techmakers Udacity Scholarship whose deadline was June 9, 2017. I encouraged my roommate to apply for the scholarship. Both of us were rejected. 😢 It never hurts to try applying again. It is my day! 🌈☀️ 2018-01-11 ThursdayThe excitement to receive Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship disappears! There is a big difference between Udacity and FreeCodeCamp: projects. Projects on FreeCodeCamp requires students to finish complete websites. In the future, you can show your websites to other people. Here are the first two FreeCodeCamp projects made by me: Github Repo | Project 1: Tribue Github Repo | Project 2: Personal Portfolio Each project took several hours to finish. It was hard but doable. (This is the essence of learning.) In the process of doing projects, I learned how to read official documents of Bootstrap and jQuery without effort. FreeCodeCamp did not teach this. I think almost all students will learn it naturally when working on FreeCodeCamp projects. The first two projects on Udacity Project: Mockup to Article Project: Animal Trading Cards (20 minutes) From the title and time suggested, you can see that the projects are a duplicate of other people’s work. Hence, you definitely cannot show them to your friends, coworkers, or future employers. Udacity’s projects are a mix of tutorials and exercise. It will teach students what students will use in the “projects” first, and then ask students to reproduce the example. Do you know that every tutorial on FreeCodeCamp is a mix of tutorials and exercise? But FreeCodeCamp does not treat them as a project. They are just tutorials. With the same amount time spent, you will learn more from FreeCodeCamp than from Udacity. This is the reason I used the strikethrough: Link: Github Repo| Project. No more project will be produced during the study on Udacity. I feel guilty of counting the Udacity project into the challenge. Usually, I study tutorials for an hour and code for an hour every day. Solution: Count anything on Udacity into the tutorial part. Continue to do FreeCodeCamp projects. Updates I read the AMA record and here are my thoughts. Udacity puts more emphasis on social networking than the quality of learning. There are two criteria to be accepted into Round 2 and an addition one that was mentioned in the AMA record. Completion of the course before April 11. Activities in the slack and the forum. (not mentioned pubicly) Diversity Udacity uses whether students are active in the forum/slack as a critera for the quality of learning. The company cares about the leadership more than learning itself. I do not agree with the idea. Emphyasis on social networking increases my stress level of learning. I am not the fan of spending so much on social networking or collaborating. If I want to be active on either of channels, I have to use willpower to do so. This does not belong to my learning goal. As an introvert, I am reluctant to waste willpower this way. Projects will not be graded. I am disappointed. Thanks to FreeCodeCamp. I finally achieve learning and doing projects at the same time. All projects can be contributed to 100 Days of Code challenge. Udacity does not emphyasize on the projects at all. I realize that there will be few projects made by students at the end of the course. It is not a good way to track progress during study. It reminded me of my previous course on Udacity, making iOS apps. After learning that course, I cannot make an app from start to end. The order of importance: Finishing the course -&gt; Forum activity -&gt; Slack activity.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[ This project was done in the middle of 100 Days of Web Develpoment challenge. Github Repo | Project 13: Gumroad Plan Calculator Link: http://gumroadplancalculator.yingjiehu.com/ MotivationGumroad is a website to sell digital products or give out for free. The design of sales pages is convenient for customers to purchase products and the appearence of pages are comfortable to eyes. Gumroad has two plans, free plan and premium plan. Free plan: 8.5% + 30 cents per sale Premium plan: 3.5% + 30 cents per sale Gumroad did a trick on their website. Here is the pricing page. “Starts at $\$10$ a month” means there are other plan(s) to charge more. Then I clicked “Learn more” and it gave me: “Learn more” pages does not give me more information. After searching online, I found the “billing ties” page. Some users wrote the explanation of the billing tiers in details. They asked Gumroad to define “the number of customers”. Gumroad replied that it was the cumulative number of customers!!!! It is not a good premium plan. For example, you create a game and allow other people to download for free. If there are over 5,000 downloads, your premium monthly fee is at least $\$75$. (It is easy to pass 5,000 downloads for a free game.) Then you create another game and charge fees before downloading. You have to calculate which plan will charge less. The calculation is not hard. However, it is nice if there exists a calculator we can use immediately. P.S.: The other solution: You can create two Gumroad accounts, one for free stuff and the other for paid products. Milestone The website was published to internet.

MotivationsI had read some R books in the past. At that time, I input the knowledge into Anki and hoped that I could remember it in the future. My goal of reading books changes. I made some big tables of programming languages and input the R syntax into the tables. There are some other programming languages in it, such as Python and JavaScript. I will not memorize any R syntax anymore. Every time I want to use something, the tables are the first place to check. Besides, it is convenient to compare different languages. It is tough to memorize syntax if multiple programming languages are used in the same period. For example, all languages have boolean, the most basic variable type.

Tomorrow’s plan Read Chapter 1 Day 2: 2018-01-10 WednesdayBook: my R notes Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 30 minutes Review R notes taken in the past Thoughts and Emotions My book is not beside me. I reviewed R notes taken in the past to continue the challenge. I am happy to do that. Some old notes were deleted I input notes to the large programming language sheet. Statistical analysis programming languages have some unique data type that other languages do not have. For example, R has a vector data type. Elements in a vector have the same atomic data type, such as string or integer. Python has a list while JavaScript has an array. Both of them can create a vector of data, but their elements can be a mix of string and integer. A more specific example: JavaScript: var ourArray = [&quot;John&quot;, 23]; Python: things = [“shoes”, 85, 8.8, “ball”] R converts a vector of a mix of string and integer into a vector of string automatically. 123456&gt; ourArray = c(23, "John")&gt; ourArray[1] "23" "John"&gt; things = c("shoes", 85, 8.8, "balls")&gt; things[1] "shoes" "85" "8.8" "balls" Tomorrow’s plan Read Chapter 1 Day 3: 2018-01-11 ThursdayBook: Using R and RStudio for Data Management, Statistical Analysis, and Graphics (second edition) Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Chapter 1: page 1-6 Thoughts and Emotions The book is like a dictionary but is worse than a dictionary.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[ This project was done in the middle of 100 Days of Web Develpoment challenge. Github Repo | Project 12: RSnippets.com Link: RSnippets.com The site is auto-deployed. Milestone The website was published to internet. (2018-01-05 Friday) First pull Over 100 stars Support open source projectsBecome a Patron! 2018-01-05 FridayI learned several programming languages by myself and failed, such as PHP. Every time I planned to learn a new programming language, I would look for books to read, video tutorials on Lynda.com, videso on YouTube. After doing this for several times and reading books for several years, I found people provided more books than necessary in a book list for beginners. The book list is so long that it overwhelms and discourages beginners; beginners will quit after reading first several hundred pages without a completed project. Watching tutorials a faster learning method than reading. But without doing any projects or exercise after watching, forgetting is the final outcome. Usually, I have an idea, then search online for the technology involved. One project makes use of multiple programming languages. If I went through the all process of reading books first and doing projects next, I would not complete any project when considering there were a lot of things to do in other aspects of life. One solution I saw some people mentioned online is to have a project at hand before learning a language. Well, the problem is that as a beginner, I will underestimate the complexity of the projects I choose most of time. If I have a question, the answers online involve lots of knowledge I do not know, and thus I cannot understand the solutions at all. I have been in the two loops for several years, reading books which can over 500 pages or not understanding solutions online. In December 2017, I started (again) learning front-end web development with FreeCodeCamp.com. I am amazed at projects in the website. They requires limited knowledge and beginners can build a website that can be shown to other people. One thing I learned in the process is that learning and practicing should be mixed together. The method was used when we were in school. As an adult, sometimes we forget it; sometimes we rush to our goal: finish reading books; sometimes we want to have some practice, but we have no idea what projects should be picked. RSnippets.com is a website that collects projects suitable for beginners. They can proudly put completed projects on a personal portfolio page. They do not need full understanding or leanring the programming language to start a project.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Main Commitment: I will practice makeup. Start Date: 2017-12-31 This is a very personal project. Making up is a required skill for women. I thought it was a waste of time and worried about the harmful integridents in makeups. Despite my negative emotion towards makeup, I have to think about one method to push myself to learn it. This is the inspiration of the challenge. “100 Days of Challenge” can be extended to any skill that you do not enjoy but is required to be learned. Rules I will try to practice makeup once per day. I will track my progress here and push to GitHub. Watching makeup tutorials will not count towards the challenge. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days. Some important additional considerations Don’t skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks. Milestones 1 Day (Day 1: 2017-12-31 Sunday) 7 Days (Day 7: 2018-01-11 Thursday) 30 Days 60 Days 90 Days 100 Days Template for Log123456789### Day :**Today&apos;s Progress (achievements and frustrations)**: **Thoughts and Emotions:****Tomorrow&apos;s plan**&lt;hr&gt; Reference Tutorials Makeup for acne skin (Chinese) LOGDay 1: 2017-12-31 SundayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Practice based on Makeup for acne skin (Chinese) My skin color is darker than the host and I have dark circles. The eye color she used does not have an effect on my skin. Thoughts and Emotions: I like the tutorial Makeup for acne skin (Chinese) very much. Because it is suitable for acne skin. Most of the hosts have good skin (or they adjust color) and do not emphasize on how to conceal red spots. My roommate said the foundation is much lighter than my skin. I will try different foundation tomorrow. Tomorrow’s plan Try a different foundation Day 2: 2018-01-01 MondayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): I made up before going out. Thoughts and Emotions: I applied both the new foundation and old foundation. I looked whiter. Tomorrow, the only new foundation will be used. Tomorrow’s plan Use the new foundation only Day 3: 2018-01-02 TuesdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): I used the foundation stick only. It does not cover dark spot well. Thoughts and Emotions: I am not sure whether the foundation stick not well or my technique is not good. I got the foundation sticks from Clinique’s Black Friday sales one month ago. There is no foundation stick from other brand as a control group. Tomorrow’s plan Concealer with liquid lighter foundation + Foundation Stick Day 4: 2018-01-03 WednesdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Makeup before going to work. This is the first time I did it. Thoughts and Emotions: Forget about how much time would be spent time on makeup. Just do it. Then I did it. Little liquid foundation cannot cover dark spot. I think it is ok to have dark spot which makes me look not fake. I fogot applying the concealer which is close to my skin color. Tomorrow’s plan Don’t forget to apply the concealer which is close to my skin color. Day 5: 2018-01-08 MondayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Applied makeup before going to the department Thoughts and Emotions: I missed 4 days in a row. On Wednesday, I did not have time for makeup in the morning. Then the next few days, I chose to stay at home, and the motivation to makeup was near 0. I am happy to resume the challenge. Tomorrow’s plan No plan. If I continue to do it tomorrow, it will be great. Day 6: 2018-01-10 WednesdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Applied makeup around 3:30 p.m. Thoughts and Emotions: My lamp color is yellow. I cannot see the true effect from the mirrow if I makeup at night. The sky becomes darker around 3:30 p.m.. It motivated to makeup today. Day 7: 2018-01-11 ThursdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Applied makeup around 3 p.m. Thoughts and Emotions: After reading tutorials on Udacity (Grow with Google Challenge scholarship), I used makeup as a rest. Then I will do excercise on Udacity. Day 8: 2018-01-12 FridayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Applied makeup around 3 p.m. Thoughts and Emotions: I did not want to do makeup. I used the CBT method to push me to do it. Future plan]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Project: Awesome Shiny Apps for Statistics]]></title>
    <url>%2FAwesome-Shiny-Apps-for-Statistics%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[This project was done in the middle of 100 Days of Web Develpoment challenge. Github Repo | Project 9: Awesome Shiny Apps for Statistics Yesterday’s night, I suddenly had an idea to make a GitHub awesome list of Shiny Apps. The apps are specific for learning statistics, not showing results from data analysis. It is better if there will be a website automatically generated from README.md file from the GitHub repo, then the effort to keep the website and README.md being same will be zero. Usually, people contribute to an awesome list by editing README.md. It is the owner’s responsibility of the GitHub repo to sync between GitHub and the website. How to sync automatically is the most difficult part for me. My blog is using Netlify to automatically deploy. I need to learn one templating engine to combine data in README.md and templates created by a templating engine by Netlify. I started to learning Go on the YouTube. I realized that Go was a completely new language and if I wanted to use it, I had to learn a lof things. Then I recalled Front-End-Checklist using gulp. Initially, I thought gulp was a template engine. After reading one tutorial, I knew it was not and can use it to create a web page without styling through gulp-markdown. gulp-rename is used to change the filename from README.md to index.md, then gulp-markdown generated index.html. The HTML codes inside index.html do not contain head and body elements. It turns out to be an advantage. gulp-wrapper adds head and body elements before and after the codes. The resulting website was successfully deployed by Nelify. I achieved to sync between README.md and the website. Today, I spent time in changing the website style and gathered Shiny apps. I worked more than 10 hours today. I am satisfied with the result. One thing needed to improve in the future is the styling of the site. Milestone The website was published to internet. (2017-12-25 Monday) Receiving the first feedback that a teacher plans to use the list in his class (2017/12/28 Thursday) Receiving the first feedback that a teacher is using/used the list in his Support open source projectsBecome a Patron! 2017-12-26 Tuesday After one day of publishing, some numbers GitHub 16 stars 3 forks 3 watchers Twitter 31 ReTweeted 77 likes This is the first for me to get over 10 stars on GitHub and the first to get over 10 likes and retweets on Twitter. I am happy that people like the idea of the project. 2017-12-28 ThursdayI got positive feedback from mo_feezy on Reddit: Hi, cool resource. I won’t be teaching stats until next fall, but this will be handy. One milestone is achieved: Receiving the first feedback that a teacher plans to use the list in his class My initial goal is to have a mature list before next Spring semester when teachers can use it as a reference. But the majority of basic statistics are not covered by Shiny Apps in the list. I hope it will mature before next fall.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Our Japanese teacher asked us to talk about what we did last week as an oral exercise. It starts with one student asking another “週末は何をしましたか”。 The answer requires at least three sentences. We use the sentence structures taught and look up new words if necessary. The paragraphs here were what I prepared for each class. It can be a good record to show learning progress. I write Chinese sentences first, then translate them into Japanese. Chinese version below is very rough. It contains ideas more than the Japanese version. You can freely skip Chinese and read Japanese only.

    <title><![CDATA[100 Days Of Behavioral Activation for Depression (Round 1)]]></title>
    <url>%2F100-Days-of-Behavioral-Activation-for-Depression-Round-1%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Main Commitment: I will decide to do/not to do things based on behavioral activation for depression. Start Date: 2017-12-12 The goal is to be in control. The challenge is very personal and very important for me. I asked several therapists before about whether I had depression or not and none of them gave me a direct answer. Finally, a therapist who uses CBT told me that I had depression and my symptom was typical. I felt relieved and can focus on how to treat depression. When I did not get confirmed the answer, I felt frustrated and did not know the goal of the therapy and the criteria for recovery. The method was taught by the CBT therapist. The goal is to be in control. Before I decide to do/do not do things, I will ask myself whether they will increase depression after doing them. If they decrease depression or keep the depression level the same with before, they can be done. The method is easily incorporated into my thinking style but it is not a habit. The goal of making the challenge is to make it a habit. Changing thinking style is very different from skills like coding, drawing, reading paper. Then the rules will be different. Rules I will try to use it when I make decision on the project level. I will track my progress here and push to GitHub. Whether I use it or not, I must record here. Milestones 1 Day 1 (2017-12-12 Tuesday) 7 Days (2018-01-04 Thursday) 30 Days 60 Days 90 Days 100 Days Template for Log123456789### Day :**Time, Events, Thoughts and Emotions:*** Morning* Afternoon* Evening&lt;hr&gt; LogDay 1: 2017-12-12 Tuesday Afternoon open mailbox deal with letters activate 2 cards pay utility bill write today’s CBT session notes Evening bath face scrub face mask Day 2: 2017-12-13 Wednesday Morning have lunch Afternoon work web development project for only one hour Evening recite Japanese words on Anki Day 3: 2017-12-14 Thursday Morning study web develpmenent tutorials for only one hour Day 4: 2018-01-01 MondayI resumed recording anti-depressant behavior activation for depression. Though the method is close to my thinking style, I do not use it automatically so far. I want to develope this skill. Morning: When I lay on the bed this morning, getting up became a difficult thing. I told myself I would regret. Afternoon: I did not use the anti-depressant behavior activation as a rule to do things. I did recall my action of lying on the bed and thought about the it. Evening: The same with afternoon. Now it is 9 p.m.. I want to relax and told myself I would increase depression tomorrow if I did it. Day 5: 2018-01-02 Tuesday Rewrote the post to fit 100 Days of Chanllenge style. Time, Events, Thoughts and Emotions: Morning The same with yesterday. The temperature was cold and I did not want to get up. Even if I used the method, the anti-dpressant behavior activation does not help. I used the remote to open my small heater. I got up even if I knew it was still cold outside and the heater would not warm the whole room. Afternoon Around 3:40 p.m., I felt anxious and wanted to open music as a background noise. I told myself it would increase depression if I did that. Then I opened the Markdown file of the challenge and started writing introduction, rules, and goals, and formatting the challenge. Evening Bath Mask Day 6: 2018-01-03 WednesdayTime, Events, Thoughts and Emotions: Morning I haven’t been to the office for two weeks. If I do not go to the office, it will increase depression If I go to the office, not doing data analysis will increase depression. The conclusion: whether I go to the office or not will increase depression 😢 Outcome: I chose a different walking path to the office. Depression hit me several times during walking. Because the roads are not clean or organized. I did one-hour data analysis. My emotion is ok. Working long hours will increase depression. Afternoon I brought KitKat to the office. If I eat KitKat as lunch, depression will increase. Evening I did not use the technique. All activities at night have been done for several days. I can activate them without much willpower. Day 7: 2018-01-04 ThursdayTime, Events, Thoughts and Emotions: Morning: The therapist’s assistant left a voice mail to me at 8 a.m. and cancelled the today’s session. I did not listen to it until the subway started. The chain on the left boot was broken. I decided to return home and go to Macy’s to buy one pair. After one hour, I felt depression and wanted to go home. But there was one mall left. I asked myself whether I felt bad about myself if I skipped the mall. The answer was yes. Even if I did not feel happy, I pushed myself to do it. Afternoon Depression remained in the afternoon. I was working on freecodecamp 100 days challenge of coding accompanied by depression. Occasionally I asked my roommates which graph she like. It improved my mood. Evening I used the whole night to read Hugo tutorials and started to make a Hugo theme. I did not finish some 100-day challenges and had mixed feeling. On the one hand, solving one of the most concerned technology problems I have recently gave me joy. On the other hand, not doing 100-day challenges increased the stress level. Day 8: 2018-01-05 FridayTime, Events, Thoughts and Emotions: Morning Lying in bed. I decided to make a website about projects for beginners even if I know that not doing 100-day challenges would increase the stress level. But if I proposponed making the website, the stress level would increased, too. I cannot forget the ideas. There is no solution for the situation. Afternoon I thought of Behavioral Activation for Depression, but no decision was decided based on it. Evening I thought about it intensely when I bathed. I have several things that I am reluctant to do. If I do not do them, then depression ≥will increase. If I order the tasks on to-do lists from the least resistance to the highest resistance, then I do it in reverse order. Will it a good method to solve the situation? Day 9: 2018-01-06 SaturdayTime, Events, Thoughts and Emotions: Morning Lying in bed to use iPad to search online. Even if I regret, the ideas/contents I searched online remain in my mind if I did not do that. Afternoon I started to implement ideas from yesterday’s night. I listed todos from I want to do most to least willing to do. Then the items were reversed by order. I started to do from the top. I procrastinated to start doing until 5 p.m.. If I start from the items I enjoy most, I will start around noon. After doing them, I enjoyed the process and worried about the slow progress. Evening I am happy I made small toy examples. When considering there are more things needed to be done, I stressed out. Behavioral Activation for Depression does not help in the situation. Day 10: 2018-01-07 SundayTime, Events, Thoughts and Emotions: Morning I searched some stuff lying in bed. Afternoon I did not use the method. Evening I pushed myself to do challenge. Day 11: 2018-01-08 MondayTime, Events, Thoughts and Emotions: Morning It happens. Afternoon It does not happen. Evening I planned to write codes for one hour. But I overdid it and spent 3 hours. I went to sleep after 3 a.m.. I should not continue to do it even if the projects gave me fulfillment at that time. 福祸相依. Blessings and misfortunes are next-door neighbors. Day 12: 2018-01-09 TuesdayTime, Events, Thoughts and Emotions: Morning regret and stress Afternoon I did the projects in my mind. But I still feel stressful. Evening I pushed myself to be on track of doing challenges. Otherwise I will feel bad tomorrow. I spent several minutes on watching music. Even if I enjoyed the process, I regretted. Day 13: 2018-01-10 WednesdayTime, Events, Thoughts and Emotions: Morning Getting up Thinking “if I do not get up, it will increase depression” does not help me get up but increase stress. If I think the most next action of getting up, it works. Afternoon I did not use the technique but wrote the notes for the morning Evening I planned to make a project related 100 days of challenge. I did not feel good about it. Every time I thought of it, the stress increased. I finally decided to give up. This is an extremely good decision. Day 14: 2018-01-11 ThursdayTime, Events, Thoughts and Emotions: Morning Yeserday I was too excited to get Grow with Google Challenge scholarship. I slept more than usual. Afternoon My roommate helps me made the decision. I do not like to be judged based on how active I am in the forum. But it is the onlhy way to get Google round 2 scholarship. If I push myself to reply at least 5 posts everyday, it will increase my stress and depression level every day. It is hard to give up, but I did it. Evening Record Day 15: 2018-01-12 FridayTime, Events, Thoughts and Emotions: Morning get up Afternoon Made decision I worked on Udacity tutorial for only one hour. I use willpower to convince myself that I should not compare with other students. Some students start to do the 11th section, almost end of the Udacity course. Their fast progress give me a lot of pressure. I won’t be happy if I spend the whole day to learn one tutorial. makeup I did not want to do makeup. I used the method to push me to do it.

    <title><![CDATA[100 Days Of Data Challenge (Round 1)]]></title>
    <url>%2F100-Days-Of-Code-R-data-analysis-Round-1%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Main Commitment: I will code to do data analysis for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days. Start Date: 2017-12-11 A companion project to 100 Days of Reading Paper. RulesModification (2018-01-05): I found The 5-Day Data Challenge in Kaggle today . I like Data Challenge better than Data Analysis with R. The title of the post was changed from 100 Days Of Code: Data Analysis with R (Round 1) to 100 Days Of Data Challenge (Round 1). Even though no one tweets #100daysOfData, I want to use it. I will code using R or do data analysis with other software (such as Python) for at least an hour every day. Projects are counted towards the challenge: statistical analysis projects in my work projects from dissertation competitions, such as Kaggle Activties are counted towards the challenge: understand datasets in excel import data into R clean data write codes to do exploratory analysis and apply statistical model write statistical reports Activities are not counted towards the challnege: write emails to clients meet with clients/supervisors I will tweet my progress every day, with the hashtag #100DaysOfCode, #100daysOfData and #100DaysOfDataScience and note which day of the challenge I’m on. I will encourage and support at least two people each day in the #100DaysOfDataScience challenge on Twitter. I can read at most 5 tweets about #100DaysOfDataScience every day. Less is more. Don’t spend more than enough time on the social networking website. 3 Options Like tweets Leave a comment (optional) Looking at their projects and giving them feedback (no more than 10 minutes per day) I will track my progress here and push to GitHub. I will only count the days where I spend at least some of my time building projects — not the days where I spend all my coding time working through lessons and tutorials. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days. Some important additional considerations Don’t skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks. ReferenceHow to effectively scope your software projects from planning to execution The planning phase Define very specific goals for the project example: improve X by adding unit tests, supporting 20K queries per second, and reducing capped mean of user latency to &lt;= 200ms Explicitly define anti-goals, and separating must-haves and nice-to-haves. Minimize the batch size of the project by set up clear milestones and checkpoints for the project make it easy to launch only part of the project. Not only does this help break down the project, but it will also allow the team to pause or cut the project early if another, higher priority task comes up. De-risk the project as soon as possible. Two common ways of de-risking a project include working on the riskiest parts upfront prototyping the riskiest parts using dummy data and/or scaffolding. Whenever a new open-source system or external service is used, that usually represents a big risk. Don’t optimize for the total amount of work done. Instead, optimize for the total amount of impact over time. Once you’ve gotten the riskiest part out of the way, prioritize working on the part of the project that would result in the highest amount of impact immediately. Here’s one way to think about this: plot the impact of a project over time, where the Y-axis is impact, and the X axis is time. At the start of the project, the impact is 0%, and at the end of the project, the impact is 100%. You want to maximize the area under the curve by doing high ROI tasks first. Try to avoid rewriting big systems from scratch as much as possible. When doing a rewrite, we tend to underestimate how much work it would be be tempted to add new features and improvements build an overly complicated system because we are too focused on all the shortcomings of the first system. Instead of doing a big rewrite, consider incrementally replacing subsystems. Have good abstraction layers that support swapping out one part of the old system at a time, so you don’t need to wait for everything to be done to test the new system. The scoping phase Divide the project into small tasks, each taking two days or less. Define measurable milestones to get to the project goal. Schedule each with a specific calendar date representing when you expect this milestone to be reached. Then, establish some sort of external accountability on these milestones by, for example, committing them to your manager and setting up milestone check-ins. Think of project time estimates as probability distributions, not best-case scenarios. Instead of telling someone that a feature will be finished in 6 weeks, tell them something like “there’s a 50% likelihood of finishing the feature in 4 weeks, and a 90% chance we’d finish it in 8 weeks.” This tends to force people to be more realistic. Add buffer to account for: (1) Dev time != calendar time, due to meetings, interviews, and holidays. I usually multiply the dev time by 1.5 to get to the calendar time. (2) Unexpected project tasks time, since there are always tasks that you didn’t realize you need to do until much later. These tasks could include refactoring old code, debugging strange behaviors, or adding tests. The more experienced you are at scoping, the smaller this multiplier will get. Resist the temptation to under-scope. Be honest about how long tasks will take, not how long you or someone else (such as your manager or the Go To Market team) wants them to take. Use historical data. Keep track of whether you’ve tended to over scope or under scope projects in the past (most people tend to under scope). Adjust your scoping accordingly. Consider timeboxing open-ended parts of the project. Instead of “find the best stream processing framework for this system,” which can take months of research and prototyping, timebox it to “find a suitable streaming processing framework in a week.” Use your judgment here to balance this against incurring long-term operational overhead. The execution phase Re-scope regularly during the project execution. For each task, track how much time you estimated the task would take, then how long it actually took you to complete it. Do this for every measurable milestone. If your scoping is off by 50% for the first parts of the project, odds are your scoping will also be off by 50% for the rest of the project. Use milestones to answer “how’s the project going?” As engineers, it’s tempting to answer “it’ll be done by next week” or “until end of this month.” But these types of vague answers tend to create projects that are always 2 weeks away from being finished. Instead, use the (re-scoped) milestones to give a concrete answer based on how much work is left.

Thinking of the idea that I have to rename all columns one by one, I feel scared. Today I learned parts of tidyverse package in Lynda.com. I thought it was a good package. When I start using it, I missed the old method. But when I saw base R converted all character variables into factor variable after import, I missed tidyverse. I had mixed feelings about both base R and tidyverse. Day 2: 2018-01-03 WednesdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): One hour work Cleaned the dataset column by column Wrote a Markdown table to record Thoughts and Emotions I did not finish the cleaning. I know cleaning is faster if I use SAS. I know the one hour work is not productive. But it gave me less pressure. I set a one-clock timer. I can feel that when it was approaching one hour, the stress level increased. Every time I work long hour until burning out, it will make it harder to start work next time. My goal is not the speed or productivity but consistency. Tomorrow’s plan Clean data Make descriptive data of variables left in the cleaned data Write report Run simple logistic analysis of batch effect and Reasons Day 3: 2018-01-05 FridayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): I created a R package project for beginners on RSnippets.com. It is to build a utility package for personal usage. I started to make one. Thoughts and Emotions I did not do this challenge again. The small project can get me started. This is the reason I did a project for beginners, not a big project. I feel good at the end of one-hour session. Tomorrow’s plan Clean data Make descriptive data of variables left in the cleaned data Write report Run simple logistic analysis of batch effect and Reasons Day 4: 2018-01-06 SaturdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Read the post about how changing location will affect the linear regression result. Reproduce the example from Sean I created 2 toy examples: $y = 0.2x$ $y = 0.2x+x^2$ $x$ is uniform(-0.5,0.5). $x$ in the program means uniform(0,1). If the true model is linear The above graph shows fitted models look almost the same when the location of $x$ is changed. The above graph shows the intercept will decrease when the location of $x$ becomes bigger. This conforms to the mathematical proof. $$y = 0.2x = (0.2-0.2a) + (x+0.2a)$$ $0.2-0.2a$ is the intercepts after $x$ moves. It has the linear relationship with $a$. However, in theory, the coefficient of $x$ remains the same. In fact, it changes a little bit. If the true model is non-linear The above two graphs show that the location has big impact on cofficients for non-linear models. Around 800 and -800, lm fails to estimate a coefficient for the quadratic term, &amp; gives a warning about a singular design matrix. The relationship between intercept and location is not linear anymore. In summary, if the scale of predictors is big, such as over 800, it is a good choice to center them first before performing any data analysis.

    <url>%2F100-Days-Of-Japanese-Round-1%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Main Commitment: I will recite Japanese words with Anki to increase Japanese vocabulary. Start Date: 2017-12-10 BackgroundI learned Japanese once per week for one semester at a night school around 10 years ago in China. I started learning Japanese this July. One day my friend asked me out to have lunch. During the meal, she said her Japanese first class of a session would begin at night. I was curious about how Americans learned Japanese, then audited the class. I was impressed by the teacher’s experience. Her native language is Chinese, the same with me. She had been lived in Japanese for 10 years and spoke English so fluently that American employees in the night school did not recognize that she was a foreigner. She is a talented and easy-going person. I enjoyed the class and decided to register one session. Each session has 10 classes, one class per week. I already finished one session with her and currently am taking the second session. Since August, I have been using Anki to recite Japanese words. Hence, the 100-day challenge should be easy for me. Rules I will review at least 100 Japanese cards in Anki every day. The words are from Genki books and core 10k words. One word has more than 5 cards. One hundred cards are not equal to 100 unique words. I will tweet my progress every day, with the hashtag #100DaysOfJapanese and note which day of the challenge I’m on. I will encourage and support at least two people each day in the #Anki #Japanese challenge on Twitter. I can read at most 5 tweets about #Anki #Japanese each day. Less is more. Don’t spend more than enough time on the social networking website. 3 Options Like tweets Leave a comment I will track my progress here and push to GitHub. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days. Some important additional considerations Don’t skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks. Milestones 1 Day (Day 1: 2017-12-10 Sunday) 7 Days (Day 7: 2017-12-16 Saturday) 30 Days 60 Days 90 Days 100 Days Template for Log12345678### Day : **No. of Anki Cards**:**Time spent**:**Thoughts and Emotions:**&lt;hr&gt; LogDay 1: 2017-12-10 SundayNo. of Anki Cards: 292 Time spent: 34 minutes Thoughts and Emotions: I cannot concentrate on review Anki cards. A probable reason is a worry about whether I can get positive feedback. There are only 4 tweets under #100DaysOfJapanese. Too few people. Then I searched weibo, which is Chinese version counterpart of Twitter. People there either posted a picture to show their completion without showing process or stopped within 30 days. It is a little bit discouraging. I am not sure whether I should incorporate social media during the challenge. Day 2: 2017-12-11 MondayNo. of Anki Cards: 313 Time spent: 36 minutes Thoughts and Emotions: I am happy that I found the community in the twitter. #100DaysOfJapanese is not a right hashtag. People use #Anki #Japanese to indicate they use Anki to learn Japanese. Day 3: 2017-12-12 TuesdayNo. of Anki Cards: 525 Time spent: 62 minutes Thoughts and Emotions: There are over 600 cards in the backlog. In recent days, I focus on reviewing old cards; no new cards. Day 4: 2017-12-13 WednesdayNo. of Anki Cards: 886 Time spent: 104 minutes Thoughts and Emotions:I cleared the backlog. What a relief! Tomorrow I can recite new words. Day 5: 2017-12-14 ThursdayNo. of Anki Cards: 576 (100 new cards) Time spent: 72 minutes Thoughts and Emotions: 100 new cards Day 6: 2017-12-15 FridayNo. of Anki Cards: 447 Time spent: 51 minutes Thoughts and Emotions:Unhappy Day 7: 2017-12-16 SaturdayNo. of Anki Cards: 335 Time spent: 40 minutes Thoughts and Emotions:I am stressed out recently. Day 8: 2017-12-18 MondayNo. of Anki Cards: 407 Time spent: 41 minutes Thoughts and Emotions: I skipped yesterday. 😢 But I reviewed faster during commute today. 😊 Day 9: 2017-12-19 TuesdayNo. of Anki Cards: 379 Time spent: 42 minutes Thoughts and Emotions: I am worry about grammar. I should spend more time on it. Day 10: 2017-12-20 WednesdayNo. of Anki Cards: 250 Time spent: 25 minutes Thoughts and Emotions: Reviewing during commuting. Day 11: 2017-12-21 ThursdayNo. of Anki Cards: 120 Time spent: 12 minutes Thoughts and Emotions: I forced myself to review at least 100 cards. Day 12: 2018-01-08 MondayNo. of Anki Cards: 216 Time spent: 21 minutes Thoughts and Emotions: I missed 17 days in a row because my Japanese class was over and motivation disappeared. My friend and I decided to take private Japanese class. Yesterday I said the class could begin next week and my motivation is back 😂]]></content>

    <url>%2F100-Days-Of-Web-Development-Round-1%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Main Commitment: I will make projects to develope front-end develoment skill. Start Date: 2017-12-06 Rules I will code to make projects from FreeCodeCamp for at least an hour every day. I will tweet my progress every day, with the hashtag #100DaysOfCode #GoogleUdacityScholars #GrowWithGoogle #freecodecamp and note which day of the challenge I’m on. I will track my progress here and push to GitHub. My daily job is not related to front-end development. All time spent on working on web development will count towards the challenge. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days. I will encourage and support at least two people each day in the #100DaysOfCode #GoogleUdacityScholars #GrowWithGoogle and #100DaysOfCode #freecodecamp challenge on Twitter. I can read at most 5 tweets about #100DaysOfCode #GoogleUdacityScholars #GrowWithGoogle #freecodecamp each day. Less is more. Don’t spend more than enough time on the social networking website. 3 Options Like tweets Leave a comment (optional) Looking at their projects and giving them feedback (no more than 10 minutes per day) Rule Updates 2018-01-11: I got Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship today. Hence, I added #GoogleUdacityScholars #GrowWithGoogle to the hashtag list. Some important additional considerations Don’t skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks. Milestones 1 Day (Day 1: 2017-12-06 Wednesday) 7 Days (Day 7: 2017-12-12 Monday) Day 18 (2017-12-25 Monday): Make the first personal project Project 9: Awesome Shiny Apps for Statistics and get over 10 stars on GitHub within one day 30 Days (2018-01-07 Sunday) 60 Days 90 Days 100 Days Project list Github Repo | Project 1: Tribue Github Repo | Project 2: Personal Portfolio Github Repo | Project 3: Random Quote Machine Github Repo | Project 4: the Local Weather Github Repo | Project 5: A Wikipedia Viewer Project 6: Visualize Data with a Bar Chart Project 7: visualize Data with a Scatterplot Graph Project 8: Visualize Data with a Heat Map 2017-12-25 Github Repo | Project 9: Awesome Shiny Apps for Statistics 2017-12-26 Github Repo | Project 10: Must-Watch Must-Watch List 2017-12-26 Github Repo | Project 11: Awesome Checklist Checklist 2018-01-05 Github Repo | Project 12: RSnippets.com 2018-01-08 Github Repo | Project 13: Gumroad Plan Calculator 2018-01-09 Github Repo | Project 14: Awesome Lifehack Calculators Template for Log1234567891011### Day : **Link**: [Github Repo]() | [Project :]()**Today&apos;s Progress (achievements and frustrations)**: **Thoughts and Emotions:****Tomorrow&apos;s plan**&lt;hr&gt; LOGDay 1: 2017-12-06 WednesdayLink: Github Repo | Project 1: Tribue Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): finished the first project “Build a Tribute Page”. Thoughts and Emotions: I finished the tutorials of Bootstrap and jQuery. After that, I started the first project “Build a Tribute Page”. Zhuge Liang is a historical figure that I admire. I feel excited to make a tribute page to him. Today is the first time I use Bootstrap though I heard it a lot in the past. This tool is awesome. It’s an intense work. Luckily, all questions along the way were solved by myself. It took around 3 hours. Day 2: 2017-12-07 ThursdayLink: Github Repo | Project 2: Personal Portfolio Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Started the second project “Personal Portfolio”. Worked on toggle button and scrollspy for at least 4 hours. Finally solved. Thank @keller0 Cai and @meitounaoqiao 殷蔚乔 for help in FreeCodeCamp/chinese. Thoughts and Emotions:I already have had a personal website, and my daily job is not website development. But I want to have a fancy project page. My purpose to do the “Personal Protolio” project is to list my projects in all fields I am interested in, such as data science, web development. In the future, the list of fields will increase. The project page is ready for it. Today is a tough day. “Personal Portfolio” is a difficult project. I spent several hours in navigation which uses scrollspy and toggle button. There are some differences in scrollspy between Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap 4. I felt discouraged and wasted time. Then I decided to seek help online. This is a right decision. FreeCodeCamp/chinese is the channel most suitable for me. Reference: Scroll @Bootstrap 4 Scroll @Bootstrap 4 beta Navbar togglers Day 3: 2017-12-08 FridayLink: Github Repo | Project 2: Personal Portfolio Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): edit the first section add 100-DAY CHALLENGES section change Awesome Font Icon from 4 to 5 Thoughts and Emotions: I am a little bit depressed today. The whole day I searched one content on iPad lying in bed. At night I got up, had dinner, took a shower, and did laundry. And then I started resuming doing the yesterday’s work. Even if I made big progress yesterday, I spent almost all day to work the project. It is very bad. Other important things are pushed away, and this will increase my stress level. The result is that I will burn out more easily and the probability of quitting the 100-day challenge will increase. I promised myself at around 6 that I would do the project for one hour. To make it work, I set a timer. Sadly, I broke the promise and worked much longer than I promised. It is 3 a.m. now. Today I almost finished the 2nd project Personal Portfolio except for one problem: collapsable menu. This is an example from w3 school. When the screen is small, the menu is collapsed. When I open the menu, the menu is overlapped with the content below. I posted the question in the gitter of FreeCodeCamp. I will go to sleep and hope that the answer will appear tomorrow. Day 4: 2017-12-09 SaturdayLink: Github Repo | Project 2: Personal Portfolio Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): changed color scheme added jump to top button asked yesterday’s question in FreeCodeCamp forum because I got no answer in the gitter Finished Project 2: Personal Portfolio Thoughts and Emotions: I started coding at 12 a.m. because I spent a lot of time during the day in freeing up space for Mac Air to install Mac OS High Sierra. Initially, I planned to finish project 2 in one hour and spend two hours in fact. The final color scheme of the website still looks strange. After I learn following courses in FreeCodeCamp in the future, I can polish the website. Finishing one not-perfect product is better than a never-finish product. Day 5: 2017-12-10 SundayLink: Github Repo | Project 3: Random Quote Machine Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Project 2 “Personal Portfolio” amendment added padding to the right of icons added icons in front of titles of sections Started Project 3 “Random Quote Machine” Thoughts and Emotions: There are lots of JavaScript tutorials before project 3 in freeCodeCamp. If I start projects until finishing tutorials, I will forget much knowledge I have learned so far, and it will be harder to continue 100DaysCoder challenge. I plan to complete CSS part of projects and started Javascript part until I studied all JavaScript tutorials. Today’s plan was 2-hour tutorial and 1-hour coding. Studying tutorials for 2 hours was as planned. However, I spent much more time in coding than one hour. It is hard to start and harder to stop. It happens to all aspects of my life. I do not know how to solve it. Happiness was generated when one-hour coding was completed. Stress increased as time came by after one hour. I am happy that I found a useful Atom plugin Auto-live-server . It refreshed the local webpage when web development related files are saved. There is one problem I asked in the gitter. Button’s border style is not consistent with different browsers. Here is my code. 12345678910button &#123; color: white; background-color: pink; box-shadow: 0; border:none;&#125; button:focus &#123; border:none;&#125; Chrome has a border around the button after I click it. Safari and codepen do not have the border. Tomorrow’s plan study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge) Project 3 Random Quotes Machine move CSS to main.css rethink how to structure css file adjust the width of border of quotes adjust the size of social media icons Project 2 Project Portolio look for a picture for Project 2 change Project 2 status from Ongoing to Complete add Project 3 and set it Ongoing create a new challenge Day 6: 2017-12-11 MondayLink: Github Repo | Project 2: Personal Portfolio Github Repo | Project 3: Random Quote Machine Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): completed the plan set yesterday!! Project 2 Project Portolio move CSS to main.css move JavaScript to /scripts Styling using pure CSS takes a lot of time. Adding a graph is simpler and more beautiful. Thoughts and Emotions: Before learning in freecodecamp, I thought front-end development incorporated designing websites. I like coding part but not designing. Two parts are knitted together during the process of learning. Projects showing from other students in freecodecamp are more beautiful than my page. This made me feel bad. It is satisfying to change project status from “ongoing” to “complete” and add new projects to my project portfolio page. Again, when I started doing projects, it is hard to stop. Now is 12 a.m. Tomorrow’s plan study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge) Start to do the html part of Project 4: the Local Weather for one hour only. Don’t overdo. Day 7: 2017-12-12 TuesdayLink: Github Repo | Project 4: the Local Weather Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): I finished all items on the todo list created yesterday. Thoughts and Emotions: It is the 7th day!! I have been doing this challenge for one week. It is the 2nd milestone 😃 Though HTML part of Project 4 is simpler than that of Project 3, I was amazed that I finished building it in one and half an hour including time of seeking help in gitter. The files of HTML and CSS are clean, and the logic of codes are clear. I am satisfied with what have been done today. I will start to code HTML part of Project 5 tomorrow. The project is cool because of both functionality and design. One hour per day is devoted to learning tutorials in FreeCodeCamp. The progress will be slow. I am overwhelmed by the number of lessons needed to learn before I can touch JavaScript part of Project 3-5. Basic algorithm scripting based on FreeCodeCamp can require around 50 hours!!! Tomorrow’s plan Study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge) Work on suggestion from gitter Start to do the HTML part of Project 5: Build a Wikipedia Viewer for one hour only. Don’t overdo. 1234567Sorin Ruse @sorinr 22:05@huyingjie add also in css background-repeat: no-repeat; to the body selector @huyingjie and also background-attachment: fixed; to make the img full width/height even when you resize the screen Sorin Ruse @sorinr 22:12@huyingjie you may also look into positioning the background and apply the one that fits your needs &lt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position&gt; Day 8: 2017-12-13 WednesdayLink: Github Repo | Project 2: Personal Portfolio Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge) Work on suggestion from gitter Start to do the HTML part of Project 5: Build a Wikipedia Viewer for one hour only. Don’t overdo. Add Project 4 to project page Thoughts and Emotions: The time spent on adding new projects to project page was longer than I expected. The list of projects is formatted by decks with Bootstrap 4. I feel the design is a little bit uncomfortable but don’t know why. At the end of today’s task, I asked the question in FreeCodeCamp forum. There is no time to touch project 5 today. It will be tomorrow’s task. Basic algorithm scripting based on FreeCodeCamp can require around 50 hours. This makes me feel nervous. The best way to remove the negative emotion is to have a try. I did one algorithm and learned the format of algorithm scripting. The problems in the section are to use JavaScript array methods learned in the last section. Array methods are similar to Swift I learned 2 years ago. Even though I forgot the details of Swift, familiarity can help me learn counterparts in JavaScript. Tomorrow’s plan Study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge) Start to do the HTML part of Project 5: Build a Wikipedia Viewer for one hour only. Don’t overdo. Read answers in FreeCodeCamp forum. Day 9: 2017-12-14 ThursdayLink: Github Repo | Project 2: Personal Portfolio Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): I read the reply to Personal Portfolio site feedback in FreeCodeCamp forum. The reply gave 6 points needed to improve. 5 points I solved today Make sure the items have a bit of space around them on smaller screens. On a mobile they go right to the edge of the screen, which looks a bit cramped. Solution: add padding: 80px to .section 123456section &#123; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px; box-shadow: 0px 2px rgb(160,160,160); padding: 80px;&#125; Make sure the images align - the ‘Ongoing’ header seems to push the image down a bit further than the ones on completed projects. Originally, I used &lt;span class=&quot;fa-layers fa-fw fa-2x&quot;&gt;. After deleting fa-2x, it became &lt;span class=&quot;fa-layers fa-fw&quot;&gt; and the problem solved. 123456&lt;span class="fa-layers fa-fw"&gt; &lt;div class="fa-3x"&gt; &lt;i class="fas fa-certificate text-danger"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="fa-layers-text fa-inverse text-warning" data-fa-transform="shrink-11.5 rotate--30 right-5"&gt;NEW&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The sections could do with a bit more vertical spacing at the bottom Solution: add padding: 80px to .section The same with the first one. It’s Code not Codes Solution: replace Codes with Code There’s a broken link to style.css Solution: delete the link 1 point I did not solve On intermediate screen sizes the items get very narrow - maybe reduce the number of items per row sooner Thoughts and Emotions: Making small adjustments or improvements to the website can take as much time as making one. I spent over 1 hour in correcting Project 2: Personal Portfolio only. It is a little bit discouraging because I have included starting Project 5 in tomorrow’s plan for two days, but there is no time left for this project. Tomorrow’s plan Study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge) Start to do the HTML part of Project 5: Build a Wikipedia Viewer for one hour only. Don’t overdo. Day 10: 2017-12-15 FridayLink: Github Repo | Project 5: A Wikipedia Viewer Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Started project 5 Thoughts and Emotions: I finally started Project 5. Among the only 5 projects, this is the first project which uses jQuery. I am excited to see the page has animation; if a user clicks the search icon, the search bar will appear and the search icon will disappear. It is fun. Tomorrow’s plan Study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge) Project 5: A Wikipedia Viewer Adjust the style of search bar Make the search icon and the search bar the same height Change action field to search button Adjust animation If search bar is empty, click search button, the search bar will disappear and the search icon will appear. If search bar is not empty, searching action is activated Add footer to Project 3: Random Quote Machine Add footer to Project 4: the Local Weather Day 11: 2017-12-16 SaturdayLink: Github Repo | Project 5: A Wikipedia Viewer Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations):I finished 4 items in yesterday’s plan. frustration: alignment of footer How a search button is put inside a search text bar? How positions of the search button and search text bar are not change when screen size changes? I will questions tomorrow in gitter. Thoughts and Emotions: Today is the toughest day. I struggle with several things in my personal life. During the day, I tried putting dynamic graphs generated by R package on the blog. There are no JavaScript library link and JavaScript code block containing data, then I cannot paste them to a Markdown or HTML file. R community including statistics community lacks good documentation and coding quality is poor. My knowledge of R never seems sufficient to find the solution to them. I feel constricted and frustrated all the time. Yesterday I thought I could finish the Basic Algorithm Script today. It is more difficult than I expected. If a function has lots of argument without argument name, use Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 0) to get all arguments array.slice()‘s second argument is the end index - 1, not the number of characters to be sliced. I guess writing pseudocode before programming will help. Tomorrow’s plan Study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge) Project 5: A Wikipedia Viewer ask in gitter alignment of footer How a search button is put inside a search text bar? How positions of the search button and search text bar are not change when screen size changes? Adjust the style of search bar Make the search icon and the search bar the same height Adjust animation If search bar is empty, click search button, the search bar will disappear and the search icon will appear. If search bar is not empty, searching action is activated Day 12: 2017-12-19 TuesdayLink: Github Repo | Project 3: Random Quote Machine Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge)Project 3 Created a JSON file containing ancient Chinese sayings Generate a random integer to select which sayings to show Get JSON data from the JSON file Calculate length of the JSON data Get the first element of the first element in the JSON data Thoughts and Emotions: I skipped two days because I prepared a presentation for today’s seminar. I did not follow the plan created on 2017-12-16 because I finished “Basic Algorithm Scripting” part (accumlatively around 7 hours) and started learning “JSON APIs and Ajax”. I want to apply the knowledge learned today to today’s work. I finished 5 things under Project 3 in Today’s progress. Each thing requires me searching online. They are not easy tasks for a newbie. Hence, they created a lot of frustration. I am a little bit discouraged by the slow process. When I thought of the fact that they were done in 1 hour, it created more hope. Tomorrow’s plan Study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge) Do Project 3 for 1 hour: Make each element in JSON data appear in HTML Click button to change the quote If there is time left, Create a JSON file of colors Generate random number for colors Edit HTML to change color Day 13: 2017-12-20 WednesdayLink: Github Repo | Project 3: Random Quote Machine Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Finished “JSON APIs and Ajax” section. Started “Intermediate Algorithm Scripting” section. Within one hour, I finished items on the yesterday’s plan and addition plan. Thoughts and Emotions: It is fun. I like animation very much. Learning Making animation using Adobe Animator requires a lot of energy and time. Animation provided by JavaScript gives me enough joy, and its complexity is not overwhelming. In the future, I want to learn more. I like to create interactive graphs of data. It is also related to my major. Tomorrow I will start learning data visualization on the beta website and suspend “Intermediate Algorithm Scripting” part until projects from data visualization are completed. After finishing Project 3, I will start data visualization projects. Joe Warren wrote a post on freeCodeCamp medium, How to Transform Your #100DaysOfCode Log Into a Visual Experience. He gave a lot of good advice on how to create a good log of 100 days challenge. He used his log as an example. In the comment, I asked whether he could give some advice on my log. He kindly gave me a long reply. Tomorrow’s plan Study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge) Project 3: Random Quote Machine Enlarge quote icon Add tumblr share action Add twitter share action Add quote: animation show quote icon wait for 1 second show the quote Day 14: 2017-12-21 ThursdayLink: Github Repo | Project 3: Random Quote Machine Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Started learning D3.js Added Twitter share action Thoughts and Emotions: Adding Twitter share action took more time than I expected. I like to read examples in the process of learning but Twitter API website has few examples. I am depressed today. I don’t know why. I spent a lot of time trying how to change the style of outputs from R notebook made by RStudio. A lot of time was spent on editing existing CSS file. At last, I found I did not need to touch any existing stylesheet. It is enough to create a new sheet and to include it after existing sheet. This is the fastest way to change the style from other people’s CSS. Tomorrow’s plan Studied tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge) Project 3: Random Quote Machine Add tumblr share action Add quote: animation show quote icon wait for 1 second show the quote Day 15: 2017-12-22 FridayLink: Github Repo | Project 3: Random Quote Machine Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Learned Data Visualization on Freecodecamp Beta website Opened and closed an issue in GitHub Completed Project 3: Random Quote Machine Thoughts and Emotions: I met a lot of arrow functions in the Data Visualization tutorials. Arrow functions from ES6 are taught in the Beta, not on the main website. I did not know the name of the function. When I searched closure function, tutorials online gave the normal functions. Then I asked this question in gitter. One person kindly answered it. I will learn arrow functions tomorrow first. I opened one issue on freecodecamp GitHub I used Chrome to do challenges. When the test did not pass, initially I thought the reason was that I did not know arrow functions. Then the code was copied to an empty HTML file. The bar plot was correctly shown. I guessed it was a browser issue and used Safari to run the same challenge. Safari passed my code. This made me confirmed that some code on the page on the website behaved differently between browsers. Update: After restarting the computer, chrome works, and then I closed the GitHub issue. My Mac Air was connected to an external monitor. After several days usage, it has some problems, such as Chrome. Restarting the laptop can solve them. Tomorrow’s plan Study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge) Start data visualization project Day 16: 2017-12-23 SaturdayLink: Project 6: Visualize Data with a Bar Chart Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Started doing Project 6: Visualize Data with a Bar Chart frustration The footer cannot be centered at the bottom The location of d3 graph is not adjusted with HTML. The height of bar plot should be adjusted Thoughts and Emotions: Styling is more difficult than visualization for me. I used Bootstrap 4 and footer cannot be centered at the bottom. It is annoying. Tomorrow’s plan Study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge) Project 6: Visualize Data with a Bar Chart Day 17: 2017-12-24 SundayLink: Project 6: Visualize Data with a Bar Chart Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Did Project 6: Visualize Data with a Bar Chart Did Project 7: visualize Data with a Scatterplot Graph Did Project 8: Visualize Data with a Heat Map Created a banner for the challenge Based on the knowledge I learned from FreeCodeCamp, I cannot finish any of them then I started a new one. After learning all tutorials of data visualization, I will search online for the things not taught in FreeCodeCamp. Thoughts and Emotions: Learning data visualization is more boring than I expected. It seems more difficult than JavaScript because all functions are self-defined and sometimes do not conform standard JavaScript function construction rule. Tomorrow’s plan Study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge) Change project status Add new projects Project 6: Visualize Data with a Bar Chart Day 18: 2017-12-25 MondayLink: Github Repo | Project 9: Awesome Shiny Apps for Statistics Github Repo | Project 3: Random Quote Machine Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Changed colors in the Project 3: Random Quote Machine. Finished Project 9: Awesome Shiny Apps for Statistics Github Repo | Project 10: Must-Watch Must-Watch List Thoughts and Emotions: @crossey on the gitter told me that colors in the Project 3: Random Quote Machine were not good. I guessed that colors were too vivid and eyes did not feel comfortable when seeing them. I found that most of the colors that had color names and beganb with “light” were suitable for eyes. Yesterday’s night, I suddenly had an idea to make a GitHub awesome list of Shiny Apps. The apps are specific for learning statistics, not showing results from data analysis. It is better if there will be a website automatically generated from README.md file from the GitHub repo, then the effort to keep the website and README.md being same will be zero. Usually, people contribute to an awesome list by editing README.md. It is the owner’s responsibility of the GitHub repo to sync between GitHub and the website. How to sync automatically is the most difficult part for me. My blog is using Netlify to automatically deploy. I need to learn one templating engine to combine data in README.md and templates created by a templating engine by Netlify. I started to learning Go on the YouTube. I realized that Go was a completely new language and if I wanted to use it, I had to learn a lof things. Then I recalled Front-End-Checklist using gulp. Initially, I thought gulp was a template engine. After reading one tutorial, I knew it was not and can use it to create a web page without styling through gulp-markdown. gulp-rename is used to change the filename from README.md to index.md, then gulp-markdown generated index.html. The HTML codes inside index.html do not contain head and body elements. It turns out to be an advantage. gulp-wrapper adds head and body elements before and after the codes. The resulting website was successfully deployed by Nelify. I achieved to sync between README.md and the website. Today, I spent time in changing the website style and gathered Shiny apps. I worked more than 10 hours today. I am satisfied with the result. One thing needed to improve in the future is the styling of the site. Project 10: Must-Watch Must-Watch List was a mardown README.md file. I will add gulp to create a website syncing with README.md. Tomorrow’s plan Study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge) Change project status Add new projects Github Repo | Project 10: Must-Watch Must-Watch List Add a website Github Repo | Project 4: the Local Weather Start JavaScript part Day 19: 2017-12-26 TuesdayLink: Github Repo | Project 10: Must-Watch Must-Watch List Github Repo | Project 11: Awesome Checklist Checklist Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Created a website for Project 10: Must-Watch Must-Watch List Created and completed Github Repo | Project 11: Awesome Checklist Checklist Thoughts and Emotions: Project 10 and 11 are similar to Project 9. The most time consuming part was to search GitHub, and to found the repos. There are 100 pages on GitHub about checklists. I used at least 5 hours to finish 100 pages. The process was boring. I am satisfied with Project 11. I will add styles after learning website design. Tomorrow’s plan Study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge) Project portolio Change project status Add new projects Github Repo | Project 4: the Local Weather Start JavaScript part Day 20: 2017-12-28 ThursdayLink: Github Repo | Project 4: the Local Weather Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): I finished all items on todo list designed the day before yesterday in one hour. Thoughts and Emotions: I did not use JavaScript for several days because I studied Data Visualization and did personal projects. Hard recall can lead to better memorization after several days. I am discouraged by the websites on my wishlist. They seem complicated. A lot of decisions should be made. Example: Which Front-End framework should be used? Static website or dynamic website? If I choose dynamic websites, which Back-End framework should I use? Where to save the photos? Photos and the website will be saved in different locations. If I choose static websites Which git website to use, GitLab or BitBucket? which deploy website should I use? In addition, I have to wait until I learn Back-End knowledge. Filling mind with undecided stuff is not a comfortable experience. Besides, even if I did projects for several days, they were not FreeCodeCamp project and then I need more willpower to initiate today’s work. Tomorrow’s plan Study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge) Github Repo | Project 4: the Local Weather Obtain data from weather API Add CSS id so that the weather info will be added Connect data with HTML codes Day 21: 2017-12-29 FridayLink: Github Repo | Project 4: the Local Weather Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Project 4: Parts of CSS id were connected to data in API Add a function to transform between F and C Thoughts and Emotions: The weather channel does not show information from the weather API. There is one error 1[Deprecation] getCurrentPosition() and watchPosition() no longer work on insecure origins. To use this feature, you should consider switching your application to a secure origin, such as HTTPS. See https://goo.gl/rStTGz for more details. The corresponding code is following. 1234if (navigator.geolocation) &#123; navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function(position) &#123; &#125;&#125; In fact, the code was shown in the tutorial on FreeCodeCamp. I will search it tomorrow. Because I started doing projects from FreeCodeCamp yesterday, I started learning and programming much more easily today.

Tomorrow’s plan Study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge) Github Repo | Project 4: the Local Weather Add button in home page to change between F and C Connect the function and the button Check the replacement for navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition() function Day 24: 2018-01-01 MondayHappy New Year Link: Github Repo | Project 4: the Local Weather Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Finished all items on the yesterday’s plan. Thoughts and Emotions: Yesterday, I did not know how to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius for the coding project and had a hard time to find the least common multiple of two numbers for the algorithm on FreeCodeCamp. They made me worry about today’s study. Writing my logic on paper help me finishing algorithm part. Writing the actions of clicking texts gave me a clear vision of how to toggle. Happily, I finished both of them. navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition is deprecated. Few answers on FreeCodeCamp forum mention it because websites hosted on a personal server or GitHub can meet the problem and most of the people put the project on CodePen. The solution is to use a free geo API from http://freegeoip.net/json/ instead of Google API. Tomorrow I will rewrite related codes. When reading Twitter #100DaysOfCode #freecodecamp, I found a lot of people started 100 Day Challenge today. It’s the first day of the year!!!

Thoughts and Emotions: I used 1 day to finish HTML part and 6 days to complete JavaScript part of Project 4: the Local Weather. Each day one hour was spent on the project. Six days are too long and lost some interests. Thank myself for persisting working for one hour every day. Finally, the project is done.

Thoughts and Emotions: I spent several hours in the past to change HTML file if a project’s status was changed or a new project was added. I planned to put information of projects in a JSON file. Next time, if a project information should be updated or added, what I do is to change the JSON file. There are two JSON files, one for the projects and the other for 100-day challenges. Today I finished the 2nd part.

Thoughts and Emotions: It is a relief. I can record projects that are suitable for beginners in the RSnippets.com. If I learn something new in the future, I can actively think what small projects I can do to practice the knowledge just learned. The idea I have and the projects I made will not be “once then never see it again”. They will benefit people who have frustration during learning like me. FreeCodeCamp inspired me to do so. I made the project with Hugo. Though I did not code a lot for the project, I can more easily understand some concepts because of studying on FreeCodeCamp. Sometimes, the success of projects are not based on latest and shiny technologies but good ideas, using simple tools to achieve them, and marketing them.

At the end of one hour, I found I made a mistake. This mistake will be fixed in the next session. Project 5 is the most difficult one so far. The form is not centered. I don’t know why. The json file from Wikipedia has an error. 1Failed to load https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&amp;titles=Main%20Page&amp;prop=revisions&amp;rvprop=content&amp;format=jsonfm&amp;formatversion=2: No &apos;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&apos; header is present on the requested resource. Origin &apos;http://127.0.0.1:3000&apos; is therefore not allowed access. I searched on the FreeCodeForum. Students all face this problem. I will read it in tomorrow’s session Thoughts and Emotions: Very difficult. There are 2 parts of my study, one for doing algorithm on FreeCodeCamp, the other for making projects. Both parts are stuck today. According to my previous experience, I need to touch the problems every day and eventually they will be solved. Maybe 1 day, 2 days, or one week.

Day 31: 2018-01-08 Monday Link: Github Repo | Project 13: Gumroad Plan Calculator Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Finished the website Gumroad Plan Calculator Thoughts and Emotions: I feel reluctant to do Project 5: A Wikipedia Viewer. One of the reason is that I do not know how data in the form is transferred to JavaScript functions and how to style the forms. To achieve the goal, I spent 3 hours on a side project, Project 13: Gumroad Plan Calculator. I planned to do it for one hour, but cannot stop coding. 🤣 Tomorrow’s plan Study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge) Add Project 13 to the project page Write a post for Project 13 Add Project 13 to Rsnippets.com Do JavaScript part of Project 5: A Wikipedia Viewer Read on the forum how to solve the error.

In fact, time is also needed to be spent on marketing, publishing to GitHub, writing good README.md files, adding subdomains and so on. If the project I did is suitable for beginners, I will write a post. Writing requires time and energy. This is the reason I feel the time is very limited and I did not work on FreeCodeCamp tutorials and projects.

Today I adjusted the content and style and am strugling the url of Wikipedia’s API. I found one opensearch API but the search result from the API is not the same as that when searching on the Wikpedia page.

Day 34: 2018-01-11 ThursdayLink: Github Repo| Project Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Udacity: Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship: Front-End Web Dev Tutorial (1 hour) HTML Syntax HTML Syntax Problem Set part of “CSS Syntax” Project (1 hour): Project: Mockup to Article Thoughts and Emotions: The excitement to receive Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship disappears! There is a big difference between Udacity and FreeCodeCamp: projects. Projects on FreeCodeCamp requires students to finish complete websites. In the future, you can show your websites to other people. Here are the first two FreeCodeCamp projects made by me: Github Repo | Project 1: Tribue Github Repo | Project 2: Personal Portfolio Each project took several hours to finish. It was hard but doable. (This is the essence of learning.) In the process of doing projects, I learned how to read official documents of Bootstrap and jQuery without effort. FreeCodeCamp did not teach this. I think almost all students will learn it naturally when working on FreeCodeCamp projects. The first two projects on Udacity Project: Mockup to Article Project: Animal Trading Cards (20 minutes) From the title and time suggested, you can see that the projects are a duplicate of other people’s work. Hence, you definitely cannot show them to your friends, coworkers, or future employers. Udacity’s projects are a mix of tutorials and exercise. It will teach students what students will use in the “projects” first, and then ask students to reproduce the example. Do you know that every tutorial on FreeCodeCamp is a mix of tutorials and exercise? But FreeCodeCamp does not treat them as a project. They are just tutorials. With the same amount time spent, you will learn more from FreeCodeCamp than from Udacity. This is the reason I used the strikethrough: Link: Github Repo| Project. No more project will be produced during the study on Udacity. I feel guilty of counting the Udacity project into the challenge. Usually, I study tutorials for an hour and code for an hour every day. Solution: Count anything on Udacity into the tutorial part. Continue to do FreeCodeCamp projects. Tomorrow’s plan Study tutorials on Udacity for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge) Do JavaScript part of Project 5: A Wikipedia Viewer Look for API Read on the forum how to solve the error.

Thoughts and Emotions: Big progression on Wikipedia Viewer! This was the second time that I felt I can not know how to code. I would not implement it forever. Persisting on working for one hour a day controls the level of stress. If I work more than 3 hours on one project and do not make progress, I won’t be happy to do it again.

    <url>%2F100-Days-Of-Reading-Paper-Round-1%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[The supporting project is 100 Days Of Code Round 1 (R, data analysis) Main Commitment: I will read paper for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days. Start Date: 2017-12-18 Reference: How to effectively scope your software projects from planning to execution Rules I will read paper for at least an hour every day. I will tweet my progress every day, with the hashtag #100DaysOfReadingPaper and note which day of the challenge I’m on. I will track my progress here and push to GitHub. If I read as part of my job, I will count that time towards the challenge. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days. Some important additional considerations Don’t skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks. Template for Log12345678910### Day : **Paper: []()****Today&apos;s Progress (achievements and frustrations)**: **Thoughts and Emotions****Tomorrow&apos;s plan**&lt;hr&gt; Milestones 1 Day (Day 1: 2017-12-18 Monday ) 7 Days 30 Days 60 Days 90 Days 100 Days LOGDay 1: 2017-12-18 MondayPaper: Adaptive design methods in clinical trials – a review Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Started reading paper: Adaptive design methods in clinical trials – a review Created powerpoint to represent the paper in tomorrow’s seminar Thoughts and Emotions I delayed this challenge for at least two weeks. 😭 It was my initial motivation to start 100 Days Challenge. Because of procrastination, I started other 3 challenges 😂 100 Days Of Code: Web Development 100 Days Of Code: Data Analysis with R 100 Days Of Japanese And restarted writing in this blog which was abandoned in 2014. Three years have passed. Time flies! During three year, I posted only two posts this February. Thank you for 100 Days Challenge project. I found the way to use the blog with joy. Writing blog posts were suffering, but it is fun to use it to track progress. I add new contents every day even if no new posts are created except 4 posts about challenges. Besides, it helps me practice English writing (I am Chinese). Back to paper, it is a pain to read paper. However, I found myself enjoy creating powerpoints. Better, I copied the small section of paper into note part of slides then read it. This decreases stress to read a paper over 10 pages. Day 2: 2018-01-06Paper: Relaxed Lasso by Nicolai Meinshausen Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Started to read paper again. 😂 Thoughts and Emotions I did an experiment. If I begin to do things that have the highest resistance, will I achieve more? Will the stress level go down? Will I be happier? Reading paper is on the top list. Then I did it. I feel a little bit relief. But I postponed it to 5 p.m., and this means I will achieve less than yesterday. Completing less can increase stress level, too. Is there a balance. Tomorrow’s plan Read “Relaxed Lasso”]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[When updating R on Mac, we can uninstall the old version and install the new version. Uninstalling R is very easy on Mac. During installation of R, at least 2 folders are involved. /Applications/R.app folder: contains GUI /Library/Frameworks/R.framework folder: contains R framework (unkown) /usr/bin : contains some linksWhen uninstalling, R under Mac OS X will delete all of them. Uninstallation steps as follows: open terminal in Mac OS X run rm -rf /Library/Frameworks/R.framework /Applications/R.app \ /usr/bin/R /usr/bin/RscriptDone!

    <title><![CDATA[It is a correct choice to buy Mac Pro!]]></title>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[I usually saw some tutorials in youtube about how to use softwares. There is a high probability that people in the video used Mac to teach how to program. In the past, I feel doubt that why it happened. Last year, in the thanksgiving’s shopping season ($150 off), I decided to buy 13 inch, not too big and heavy, not too small. In the store, it was easy for me to confuse which one to buy, Mac Pro or Mac Air. The employee in the NYU Mac store said price performance ratio was better. She recommended that it was better to buy Mac Air if Mac was my secondary computer. Finally, I made the decision to buy Mac Pro 13 inch because its CPU was better than Mac Air and storage was bigger. Last week, my experience told me that it is one of the most valuable items purchased last year. I did one problem about kernel smoothing method and used guassian kernel. The training data set was big with over 7000 observations and 56 predictors. All the predictors had to be used to generate guassian kernals for each observation in test data. Then I programmed the process to create guassian kernals. For each test data, it took about 3 minutes to generate the wights. I felt it was too slow then run the same program in Lenovo Thinkpad T420. It cost third times time. One of my classmates used Mac Air to program, she could not know when the program would stop but the same program was run in Mac Pro in several seconds. Big difference! A computer with faster CPU is very important. It recalled me the time last semester. A lot of programming were required for bayesian class. Some programs were slow. If I used Mac Pro at that time, less time would be put in my homework and I did not need to stay up every week!]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[How long to write a book?]]></title>
    <url>%2FHow-long-to-write-a-book%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[How long to write a book? No correct answer to this question. My sensibility always admire people who can write the book as quickly as possible because the speed implies that they have high productivity and other abilities. My intellects know my sensibility is wrong. How to marry intellects and sensibility? I do not have answer to this question, either. One thing can be confirmed that good books take time. How long? Several years. Eric Novik planned to write a book recently, 8 chapter and over 300 pages. He asked Prof. Gelman: The work seems overwhelming. I always wondered how you manage to produce such high volume of high quality content. What’s the secret?Prof. Gelman replied in his blog:The first secret is, I wouldn’t try to write a book in 6 to 8 months. The first edition of Bayesian Data Analysis took several years. Each new edition took awhile too. So if “long and arduous” to you means “6 to 8 months,” I think your time management skills are already much better than mine!]]></content>
