    <content type="text"><![CDATA[This project was done in the middle of 100 Days of Web Develpoment challenge. Github Repo | Project 9: Awesome Shiny Apps for Statistics Yesterday’s night, I suddenly had an idea to make a GitHub awesome list of Shiny Apps. The apps are specific for learning statistics, not showing results from data analysis. It is better if there will be a website automatically generated from README.md file from the GitHub repo, then the effort to keep the website and README.md being same will be zero. Usually, people contribute to an awesome list by editing README.md. It is the owner’s responsibility of the GitHub repo to sync between GitHub and the website. How to sync automatically is the most difficult part for me. My blog is using Netlify to automatically deploy. I need to learn one templating engine to combine data in README.md and templates created by a templating engine by Netlify. I started to learning Go on the YouTube. I realized that Go was a completely new language and if I wanted to use it, I had to learn a lof things. Then I recalled Front-End-Checklist using gulp. Initially, I thought gulp was a template engine. After reading one tutorial, I knew it was not and can use it to create a web page without styling through gulp-markdown. gulp-rename is used to change the filename from README.md to index.md, then gulp-markdown generated index.html. The HTML codes inside index.html do not contain head and body elements. It turns out to be an advantage. gulp-wrapper adds head and body elements before and after the codes. The resulting website was successfully deployed by Nelify. I achieved to sync between README.md and the website. Today, I spent time in changing the website style and gathered Shiny apps. I worked more than 10 hours today. I am satisfied with the result. One thing needed to improve in the future is the styling of the site. Update 2017/12/26 Tuesday After one day of publishing, some numbers GitHub 16 stars 3 forks 3 watchers Twitter 31 ReTweeted 77 likes This is the first for me to get over 10 stars on GitHub and the first to get over 10 likes and retweets on Twitter. I am happy that people like the idea of the project.]]></content>

    <url>%2FJapanese-Class-Weekly-Paragraph%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Our Japanese teacher asked us to talk about what we did last week as an oral exercise. It starts with one student asking another “週末は何をしましたか”。 The answer requires at least three sentences. We use the sentence structures taught and look up new words if necessary. The paragraphs here were what I prepared for each class. It can be a good record to show learning progress. I write Chinese sentences first, then translate them into Japanese. Chinese version below is very rough. It contains ideas more than the Japanese version. You can freely skip Chinese and read Japanese only.

    <title><![CDATA[100 Days Of Code: Data Analysis with R (Round 1)]]></title>
    <url>%2F100-Days-Of-Code-R-data-analysis-Round-1%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Main Commitment: I will code to do data analysis for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days. Start Date: 2017-12-11 A companion project to 100 Days of Reading Paper. Rules I will code using R or do data analysis with other software (such as Python) for at least an hour every day. Projects are counted towards the challenge: statistical analysis projects in my work projects from dissertation competitions, such as Kaggle Activties are counted towards the challenge: understand datasets in excel import data into R clean data write codes to do exploratory analysis and apply statistical model write statistical reports Activities are not counted towards the challnege: write emails to clients meet with clients/supervisors I will tweet my progress every day, with the hashtag #100DaysOfCode and #100DaysOfDataScience and note which day of the challenge I’m on. I will encourage and support at least two people each day in the #100DaysOfDataScience challenge on Twitter. I can read at most 5 tweets about #100DaysOfDataScience every day. Less is more. Don’t spend more than enough time on the social networking website. 3 Options Like tweets Leave a comment (optional) Looking at their projects and giving them feedback (no more than 10 minutes per day) I will track my progress here and push to GitHub. I will only count the days where I spend at least some of my time building projects — not the days where I spend all my coding time working through lessons and tutorials. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days. Some important additional considerations Don’t skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks. ReferenceHow to effectively scope your software projects from planning to execution The planning phase Define very specific goals for the project example: improve X by adding unit tests, supporting 20K queries per second, and reducing capped mean of user latency to &lt;= 200ms Explicitly define anti-goals, and separating must-haves and nice-to-haves. Minimize the batch size of the project by set up clear milestones and checkpoints for the project make it easy to launch only part of the project. Not only does this help break down the project, but it will also allow the team to pause or cut the project early if another, higher priority task comes up. De-risk the project as soon as possible. Two common ways of de-risking a project include working on the riskiest parts upfront prototyping the riskiest parts using dummy data and/or scaffolding. Whenever a new open-source system or external service is used, that usually represents a big risk. Don’t optimize for the total amount of work done. Instead, optimize for the total amount of impact over time. Once you’ve gotten the riskiest part out of the way, prioritize working on the part of the project that would result in the highest amount of impact immediately. Here’s one way to think about this: plot the impact of a project over time, where the Y-axis is impact, and the X axis is time. At the start of the project, the impact is 0%, and at the end of the project, the impact is 100%. You want to maximize the area under the curve by doing high ROI tasks first. Try to avoid rewriting big systems from scratch as much as possible. When doing a rewrite, we tend to underestimate how much work it would be be tempted to add new features and improvements build an overly complicated system because we are too focused on all the shortcomings of the first system. Instead of doing a big rewrite, consider incrementally replacing subsystems. Have good abstraction layers that support swapping out one part of the old system at a time, so you don’t need to wait for everything to be done to test the new system. The scoping phase Divide the project into small tasks, each taking two days or less. Define measurable milestones to get to the project goal. Schedule each with a specific calendar date representing when you expect this milestone to be reached. Then, establish some sort of external accountability on these milestones by, for example, committing them to your manager and setting up milestone check-ins. Think of project time estimates as probability distributions, not best-case scenarios. Instead of telling someone that a feature will be finished in 6 weeks, tell them something like “there’s a 50% likelihood of finishing the feature in 4 weeks, and a 90% chance we’d finish it in 8 weeks.” This tends to force people to be more realistic. Add buffer to account for: (1) Dev time != calendar time, due to meetings, interviews, and holidays. I usually multiply the dev time by 1.5 to get to the calendar time. (2) Unexpected project tasks time, since there are always tasks that you didn’t realize you need to do until much later. These tasks could include refactoring old code, debugging strange behaviors, or adding tests. The more experienced you are at scoping, the smaller this multiplier will get. Resist the temptation to under-scope. Be honest about how long tasks will take, not how long you or someone else (such as your manager or the Go To Market team) wants them to take. Use historical data. Keep track of whether you’ve tended to over scope or under scope projects in the past (most people tend to under scope). Adjust your scoping accordingly. Consider timeboxing open-ended parts of the project. Instead of “find the best stream processing framework for this system,” which can take months of research and prototyping, timebox it to “find a suitable streaming processing framework in a week.” Use your judgment here to balance this against incurring long-term operational overhead. The execution phase Re-scope regularly during the project execution. For each task, track how much time you estimated the task would take, then how long it actually took you to complete it. Do this for every measurable milestone. If your scoping is off by 50% for the first parts of the project, odds are your scoping will also be off by 50% for the rest of the project. Use milestones to answer “how’s the project going?” As engineers, it’s tempting to answer “it’ll be done by next week” or “until end of this month.” But these types of vague answers tend to create projects that are always 2 weeks away from being finished. Instead, use the (re-scoped) milestones to give a concrete answer based on how much work is left.

Thinking of the idea that I have to rename all columns one by one, I feel scared. Today I learned parts of tidyverse package in Lynda.com. I thought it was a good package. When I start using it, I missed the old method. But when I saw base R converted all character variables into factor variable after import, I missed tidyverse. I had mixed feelings about both base R and tidyverse.]]></content>

    <url>%2F100-Days-Of-Japanese-Round-1%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Main Commitment: I will recite Japanese words with Anki to increase Japanese vocabulary. Start Date: 2017-12-10 BackgroundI learned Japanese once per week for one semester at a night school around 10 years ago in China. I started learning Japanese this July. One day my friend asked me out to have lunch. During the meal, she said her Japanese first class of a session would begin at night. I was curious about how Americans learned Japanese, then audited the class. I was impressed by the teacher’s experience. Her native language is Chinese, the same with me. She had been lived in Japanese for 10 years and spoke English so fluently that American employees in the night school did not recognize that she was a foreigner. She is a talented and easy-going person. I enjoyed the class and decided to register one session. Each session has 10 classes, one class per week. I already finished one session with her and currently am taking the second session. Since August, I have been using Anki to recite Japanese words. Hence, the 100-day challenge should be easy for me. Rules I will review at least 100 Japanese cards in Anki every day. The words are from Genki books and core 10k words. One word has more than 5 cards. One hundred cards are not equal to 100 unique words. I will tweet my progress every day, with the hashtag #100DaysOfJapanese and note which day of the challenge I’m on. I will encourage and support at least two people each day in the #Anki #Japanese challenge on Twitter. I can read at most 5 tweets about #Anki #Japanese each day. Less is more. Don’t spend more than enough time on the social networking website. 3 Options Like tweets Leave a comment I will track my progress here and push to GitHub. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days. Some important additional considerations Don’t skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks. Milestones 1 Day (Day 1: 2017-12-10 Sunday) 7 Days (Day 7: 2017-12-16 Saturday) 30 Days 60 Days 90 Days 100 Days Template for Log1234### Day : **No. of Anki Cards**:**Time spent**:**Thoughts and Emotions:** LogDay 1: 2017-12-10 SundayNo. of Anki Cards: 292 Time spent: 34 minutes Thoughts and Emotions: I cannot concentrate on review Anki cards. A probable reason is a worry about whether I can get positive feedback. There are only 4 tweets under #100DaysOfJapanese. Too few people. Then I searched weibo, which is Chinese version counterpart of Twitter. People there either posted a picture to show their completion without showing process or stopped within 30 days. It is a little bit discouraging. I am not sure whether I should incorporate social media during the challenge. Day 2: 2017-12-11 MondayNo. of Anki Cards: 313 Time spent: 36 minutes Thoughts and Emotions: I am happy that I found the community in the twitter. #100DaysOfJapanese is not a right hashtag. People use #Anki #Japanese to indicate they use Anki to learn Japanese. Day 3: 2017-12-12 TuesdayNo. of Anki Cards: 525 Time spent: 62 minutes Thoughts and Emotions: There are over 600 cards in the backlog. In recent days, I focus on reviewing old cards; no new cards. Day 4: 2017-12-13 WednesdayNo. of Anki Cards: 886 Time spent: 104 minutes Thoughts and Emotions:I cleared the backlog. What a relief! Tomorrow I can recite new words. Day 5: 2017-12-14 ThursdayNo. of Anki Cards: 576 (100 new cards) Time spent: 72 minutes Thoughts and Emotions: 100 new cards Day 6: 2017-12-15 FridayNo. of Anki Cards: 447 Time spent: 51 minutes Thoughts and Emotions:Unhappy Day 7: 2017-12-16 SaturdayNo. of Anki Cards: 335 Time spent: 40 minutes Thoughts and Emotions:I am stressed out recently. Day 8: 2017-12-18 MondayNo. of Anki Cards: 407 Time spent: 41 minutes Thoughts and Emotions: I skipped yesterday. 😢 But I reviewed faster during commute today. 😊 Day 9: 2017-12-19 TuesdayNo. of Anki Cards: 379 Time spent: 42 minutes Thoughts and Emotions: I am worry about grammar. I should spend more time on it. Day 10: 2017-12-20 WednesdayNo. of Anki Cards: 250 Time spent: 25 minutes Thoughts and Emotions: Reviewing during commuting. Day 11: 2017-12-21 ThursdayNo. of Anki Cards: 120 Time spent: 12 minutes Thoughts and Emotions: I forced myself to review at least 100 cards.]]></content>

Thoughts and Emotions: I finished the tutorials of Bootstrap and jQuery. After that, I started the first project “Build a Tribute Page”. Zhuge Liang is a historical figure that I admire. I feel excited to make a tribute page to him. Today is the first time I use Bootstrap though I heard it a lot in the past. This tool is awesome. It’s an intense work. Luckily, all questions along the way were solved by myself. It took around 3 hours. Day 2: 2017-12-07 ThursdayLink: Github Repo | Project 2: Personal Portfolio Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Started the second project “Personal Portfolio”. Worked on toggle button and scrollspy for at least 4 hours. Finally solved. Thank @keller0 Cai and @meitounaoqiao 殷蔚乔 for help in FreeCodeCamp/chinese. Thoughts and Emotions:I already have had a personal website, and my daily job is not website development. But I want to have a fancy project page. My purpose to do the “Personal Protolio” project is to list my projects in all fields I am interested in, such as data science, web development. In the future, the list of fields will increase. The project page is ready for it. Today is a tough day. “Personal Portfolio” is a difficult project. I spent several hours in navigation which uses scrollspy and toggle button. There are some differences in scrollspy between Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap 4. I felt discouraged and wasted time. Then I decided to seek help online. This is a right decision. FreeCodeCamp/chinese is the channel most suitable for me. Reference: Scroll @Bootstrap 4 Scroll @Bootstrap 4 beta Navbar togglers Day 3: 2017-12-08 FridayLink: Github Repo | Project 2: Personal Portfolio Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): edit the first section add 100-DAY CHALLENGES section change Awesome Font Icon from 4 to 5 Thoughts and Emotions: I am a little bit depressed today. The whole day I searched one content on iPad lying in bed. At night I got up, had dinner, took a shower, and did laundry. And then I started resuming doing the yesterday’s work. Even if I made big progress yesterday, I spent almost all day to work the project. It is very bad. Other important things are pushed away, and this will increase my stress level. The result is that I will burn out more easily and the probability of quitting the 100-day challenge will increase. I promised myself at around 6 that I would do the project for one hour. To make it work, I set a timer. Sadly, I broke the promise and worked much longer than I promised. It is 3 a.m. now. Today I almost finished the 2nd project Personal Portfolio except for one problem: collapsable menu. This is an example from w3 school. When the screen is small, the menu is collapsed. When I open the menu, the menu is overlapped with the content below. I posted the question in the gitter of FreeCodeCamp. I will go to sleep and hope that the answer will appear tomorrow. Day 4: 2017-12-09 SaturdayLink: Github Repo | Project 2: Personal Portfolio Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): changed color scheme added jump to top button asked yesterday’s question in FreeCodeCamp forum because I got no answer in the gitter Finished Project 2: Personal Portfolio Thoughts and Emotions: I started coding at 12 a.m. because I spent a lot of time during the day in freeing up space for Mac Air to install Mac OS High Sierra. Initially, I planned to finish project 2 in one hour and spend two hours in fact. The final color scheme of the website still looks strange. After I learn following courses in FreeCodeCamp in the future, I can polish the website. Finishing one not-perfect product is better than a never-finish product. Day 5: 2017-12-10 SundayLink: Github Repo | Project 3: Random Quote Machine Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Project 2 “Personal Portfolio” amendment added padding to the right of icons added icons in front of titles of sections Started Project 3 “Random Quote Machine” Thoughts and Emotions: There are lots of JavaScript tutorials before project 3 in freeCodeCamp. If I start projects until finishing tutorials, I will forget much knowledge I have learned so far, and it will be harder to continue 100DaysCoder challenge. I plan to complete CSS part of projects and started Javascript part until I studied all JavaScript tutorials. Today’s plan was 2-hour tutorial and 1-hour coding. Studying tutorials for 2 hours was as planned. However, I spent much more time in coding than one hour. It is hard to start and harder to stop. It happens to all aspects of my life. I do not know how to solve it. Happiness was generated when one-hour coding was completed. Stress increased as time came by after one hour. I am happy that I found a useful Atom plugin Auto-live-server . It refreshed the local webpage when web development related files are saved. There is one problem I asked in the gitter. Button’s border style is not consistent with different browsers. Here is my code. 12345678910button &#123; color: white; background-color: pink; box-shadow: 0; border:none;&#125; button:focus &#123; border:none;&#125; Chrome has a border around the button after I click it. Safari and codepen do not have the border. Tomorrow’s plan study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge) Project 3 Random Quotes Machine move CSS to main.css rethink how to structure css file adjust the width of border of quotes adjust the size of social media icons Project 2 Project Portolio look for a picture for Project 2 change Project 2 status from Ongoing to Complete add Project 3 and set it Ongoing create a new challenge Day 6: 2017-12-11 MondayLink: Github Repo | Project 2: Personal Portfolio Github Repo | Project 3: Random Quote Machine Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): completed the plan set yesterday!! Project 2 Project Portolio move CSS to main.css move JavaScript to /scripts Styling using pure CSS takes a lot of time. Adding a graph is simpler and more beautiful. Thoughts and Emotions: Before learning in freecodecamp, I thought front-end development incorporated designing websites. I like coding part but not designing. Two parts are knitted together during the process of learning. Projects showing from other students in freecodecamp are more beautiful than my page. This made me feel bad. It is satisfying to change project status from “ongoing” to “complete” and add new projects to my project portfolio page. Again, when I started doing projects, it is hard to stop. Now is 12 a.m. Tomorrow’s plan study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge) Start to do the html part of Project 4: the Local Weather for one hour only. Don’t overdo. Day 7: 2017-12-12 TuesdayLink: Github Repo | Project 4: the Local Weather Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): I finished all items on the todo list created yesterday. Thoughts and Emotions: It is the 7th day!! I have been doing this challenge for one week. It is the 2nd milestone 😃 Though HTML part of Project 4 is simpler than that of Project 3, I was amazed that I finished building it in one and half an hour including time of seeking help in gitter. The files of HTML and CSS are clean, and the logic of codes are clear. I am satisfied with what have been done today. I will start to code HTML part of Project 5 tomorrow. The project is cool because of both functionality and design. One hour per day is devoted to learning tutorials in FreeCodeCamp. The progress will be slow. I am overwhelmed by the number of lessons needed to learn before I can touch JavaScript part of Project 3-5. Basic algorithm scripting based on FreeCodeCamp can require around 50 hours!!!

Don’t overdo. Add Project 4 to project page Thoughts and Emotions: The time spent on adding new projects to project page was longer than I expected. The list of projects is formatted by decks with Bootstrap 4. I feel the design is a little bit uncomfortable but don’t know why. At the end of today’s task, I asked the question in FreeCodeCamp forum. There is no time to touch project 5 today. It will be tomorrow’s task. Basic algorithm scripting based on FreeCodeCamp can require around 50 hours. This makes me feel nervous. The best way to remove the negative emotion is to have a try. I did one algorithm and learned the format of algorithm scripting. The problems in the section are to use JavaScript array methods learned in the last section. Array methods are similar to Swift I learned 2 years ago. Even though I forgot the details of Swift, familiarity can help me learn counterparts in JavaScript. Tomorrow’s plan Study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge) Start to do the HTML part of Project 5: Build a Wikipedia Viewer for one hour only. Don’t overdo. Read answers in FreeCodeCamp forum. Day 9: 2017-12-14 ThursdayLink: Github Repo | Project 2: Personal Portfolio Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): I read the reply to Personal Portfolio site feedback in FreeCodeCamp forum. The reply gave 6 points needed to improve. 5 points I solved today Make sure the items have a bit of space around them on smaller screens. On a mobile they go right to the edge of the screen, which looks a bit cramped. Solution: add padding: 80px to .section 123456section &#123; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px; box-shadow: 0px 2px rgb(160,160,160); padding: 80px;&#125; Make sure the images align - the ‘Ongoing’ header seems to push the image down a bit further than the ones on completed projects. Originally, I used &lt;span class=&quot;fa-layers fa-fw fa-2x&quot;&gt;. After deleting fa-2x, it became &lt;span class=&quot;fa-layers fa-fw&quot;&gt; and the problem solved. 123456&lt;span class="fa-layers fa-fw"&gt; &lt;div class="fa-3x"&gt; &lt;i class="fas fa-certificate text-danger"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class="fa-layers-text fa-inverse text-warning" data-fa-transform="shrink-11.5 rotate--30 right-5"&gt;NEW&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The sections could do with a bit more vertical spacing at the bottom Solution: add padding: 80px to .section The same with the first one. It’s Code not Codes Solution: replace Codes with Code There’s a broken link to style.css Solution: delete the link 1 point I did not solve On intermediate screen sizes the items get very narrow - maybe reduce the number of items per row sooner Thoughts and Emotions: Making small adjustments or improvements to the website can take as much time as making one. I spent over 1 hour in correcting Project 2: Personal Portfolio only. It is a little bit discouraging because I have included starting Project 5 in tomorrow’s plan for two days, but there is no time left for this project. Tomorrow’s plan Study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge) Start to do the HTML part of Project 5: Build a Wikipedia Viewer for one hour only. Don’t overdo. Day 10: 2017-12-15 FridayLink: Github Repo | Project 5: A Wikipedia Viewer Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Started project 5 Thoughts and Emotions: I finally started Project 5. Among the only 5 projects, this is the first project which uses jQuery. I am excited to see the page has animation; if a user clicks the search icon, the search bar will appear and the search icon will disappear. It is fun. Tomorrow’s plan Study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge) Project 5: A Wikipedia Viewer Adjust the style of search bar Make the search icon and the search bar the same height Change action field to search button Adjust animation If search bar is empty, click search button, the search bar will disappear and the search icon will appear.

How positions of the search button and search text bar are not change when screen size changes? I will questions tomorrow in gitter. Thoughts and Emotions: Today is the toughest day. I struggle with several things in my personal life. During the day, I tried putting dynamic graphs generated by R package on the blog. There are no JavaScript library link and JavaScript code block containing data, then I cannot paste them to a Markdown or HTML file. R community including statistics community lacks good documentation and coding quality is poor. My knowledge of R never seems sufficient to find the solution to them. I feel constricted and frustrated all the time. Yesterday I thought I could finish the Basic Algorithm Script today. It is more difficult than I expected. If a function has lots of argument without argument name, use Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 0) to get all arguments array.slice()‘s second argument is the end index - 1, not the number of characters to be sliced. I guess writing pseudocode before programming will help. Tomorrow’s plan Study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge) Project 5: A Wikipedia Viewer ask in gitter alignment of footer How a search button is put inside a search text bar? How positions of the search button and search text bar are not change when screen size changes?

If search bar is not empty, searching action is activated Day 12: 2017-12-19 TuesdayLink: Github Repo | Project 3: Random Quote Machine Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge)Project 3 Created a JSON file containing ancient Chinese sayings Generate a random integer to select which sayings to show Get JSON data from the JSON file Calculate length of the JSON data Get the first element of the first element in the JSON data Thoughts and Emotions: I skipped two days because I prepared a presentation for today’s seminar. I did not follow the plan created on 2017-12-16 because I finished “Basic Algorithm Scripting” part (accumlatively around 7 hours) and started learning “JSON APIs and Ajax”. I want to apply the knowledge learned today to today’s work. I finished 5 things under Project 3 in Today’s progress. Each thing requires me searching online. They are not easy tasks for a newbie. Hence, they created a lot of frustration. I am a little bit discouraged by the slow process. When I thought of the fact that they were done in 1 hour, it created more hope. Tomorrow’s plan Study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge) Do Project 3 for 1 hour: Make each element in JSON data appear in HTML Click button to change the quote If there is time left, Create a JSON file of colors Generate random number for colors Edit HTML to change color Day 13: 2017-12-20 WednesdayLink: Github Repo | Project 3: Random Quote Machine Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Finished “JSON APIs and Ajax” section. Started “Intermediate Algorithm Scripting” section. Within one hour, I finished items on the yesterday’s plan and addition plan. Thoughts and Emotions: It is fun. I like animation very much. Learning Making animation using Adobe Animator requires a lot of energy and time. Animation provided by JavaScript gives me enough joy, and its complexity is not overwhelming. In the future, I want to learn more. I like to create interactive graphs of data. It is also related to my major. Tomorrow I will start learning data visualization on the beta website and suspend “Intermediate Algorithm Scripting” part until projects from data visualization are completed. After finishing Project 3, I will start data visualization projects. Joe Warren wrote a post on freeCodeCamp medium, How to Transform Your #100DaysOfCode Log Into a Visual Experience. He gave a lot of good advice on how to create a good log of 100 days challenge. He used his log as an example. In the comment, I asked whether he could give some advice on my log. He kindly gave me a long reply. Tomorrow’s plan Study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge) Project 3: Random Quote Machine Enlarge quote icon Add tumblr share action Add twitter share action Add quote: animation show quote icon wait for 1 second show the quote Day 14: 2017-12-21 ThursdayLink: Github Repo | Project 3: Random Quote Machine Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Started learning D3.js Added Twitter share action Thoughts and Emotions: Adding Twitter share action took more time than I expected. I like to read examples in the process of learning but Twitter API website has few examples. I am depressed today. I don’t know why. I spent a lot of time trying how to change the style of outputs from R notebook made by RStudio. A lot of time was spent on editing existing CSS file. At last, I found I did not need to touch any existing stylesheet. It is enough to create a new sheet and to include it after existing sheet. This is the fastest way to change the style from other people’s CSS. Tomorrow’s plan Studied tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge) Project 3: Random Quote Machine Add tumblr share action Add quote: animation show quote icon wait for 1 second show the quote Day 15: 2017-12-22 FridayLink: Github Repo | Project 3: Random Quote Machine Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Learned Data Visualization on Freecodecamp Beta website Opened and closed an issue in GitHub Completed Project 3: Random Quote Machine Thoughts and Emotions: I met a lot of arrow functions in the Data Visualization tutorials. Arrow functions from ES6 are taught in the Beta, not on the main website. I did not know the name of the function. When I searched closure function, tutorials online gave the normal functions. Then I asked this question in gitter. One person kindly answered it. I will learn arrow functions tomorrow first. I opened one issue on freecodecamp GitHub I used Chrome to do challenges. When the test did not pass, initially I thought the reason was that I did not know arrow functions. Then the code was copied to an empty HTML file. The bar plot was correctly shown. I guessed it was a browser issue and used Safari to run the same challenge. Safari passed my code. This made me confirmed that some code on the page on the website behaved differently between browsers. Update: After restarting the computer, chrome works, and then I closed the GitHub issue. My Mac Air was connected to an external monitor. After several days usage, it has some problems, such as Chrome. Restarting the laptop can solve them. Tomorrow’s plan Study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge) Start data visualization project Day 16: 2017-12-23 SaturdayLink: Project 6: Visualize Data with a Bar Chart Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Started doing Project 6: Visualize Data with a Bar Chart frustration The footer cannot be centered at the bottom The location of d3 graph is not adjusted with HTML. The height of bar plot should be adjusted Thoughts and Emotions: Styling is more difficult than visualization for me. I used Bootstrap 4 and footer cannot be centered at the bottom. It is annoying. Tomorrow’s plan Study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge) Project 6: Visualize Data with a Bar Chart Day 17: 2017-12-24 SundayLink: Project 6: Visualize Data with a Bar Chart Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Did Project 6: Visualize Data with a Bar Chart Did Project 7: visualize Data with a Scatterplot Graph Did Project 8: Visualize Data with a Heat Map Created a banner for the challenge Based on the knowledge I learned from FreeCodeCamp, I cannot finish any of them then I started a new one. After learning all tutorials of data visualization, I will search online for the things not taught in FreeCodeCamp. Thoughts and Emotions: Learning data visualization is more boring than I expected. It seems more difficult than JavaScript because all functions are self-defined and sometimes do not conform standard JavaScript function construction rule. Tomorrow’s plan Study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge) Change project status Add new projects Project 6: Visualize Data with a Bar Chart Day 18: 2017-12-25 MondayLink: Github Repo | Project 9: Awesome Shiny Apps for Statistics Github Repo | Project 3: Random Quote Machine Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Changed colors in the Project 3: Random Quote Machine. Finished Project 9: Awesome Shiny Apps for Statistics Github Repo | Project 10: Must-Watch Must-Watch List Thoughts and Emotions: @crossey on the gitter told me that colors in the Project 3: Random Quote Machine were not good. I guessed that colors were too vivid and eyes did not feel comfortable when seeing them. I found that most of the colors that had color names and beganb with “light” were suitable for eyes. Yesterday’s night, I suddenly had an idea to make a GitHub awesome list of Shiny Apps. The apps are specific for learning statistics, not showing results from data analysis. It is better if there will be a website automatically generated from README.md file from the GitHub repo, then the effort to keep the website and README.md being same will be zero. Usually, people contribute to an awesome list by editing README.md. It is the owner’s responsibility of the GitHub repo to sync between GitHub and the website. How to sync automatically is the most difficult part for me. My blog is using Netlify to automatically deploy. I need to learn one templating engine to combine data in README.md and templates created by a templating engine by Netlify. I started to learning Go on the YouTube. I realized that Go was a completely new language and if I wanted to use it, I had to learn a lof things. Then I recalled Front-End-Checklist using gulp. Initially, I thought gulp was a template engine. After reading one tutorial, I knew it was not and can use it to create a web page without styling through gulp-markdown. gulp-rename is used to change the filename from README.md to index.md, then gulp-markdown generated index.html. The HTML codes inside index.html do not contain head and body elements. It turns out to be an advantage. gulp-wrapper adds head and body elements before and after the codes. The resulting website was successfully deployed by Nelify. I achieved to sync between README.md and the website. Today, I spent time in changing the website style and gathered Shiny apps. I worked more than 10 hours today. I am satisfied with the result. One thing needed to improve in the future is the styling of the site. Project 10: Must-Watch Must-Watch List was a mardown README.md file. I will add gulp to create a website syncing with README.md. Tomorrow’s plan Study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge) Change project status Add new projects Github Repo | Project 10: Must-Watch Must-Watch List Add a website Github Repo | Project 4: the Local Weather Start JavaScript part Day 19: 2017-12-26 TuesdayLink: Github Repo | Project 10: Must-Watch Must-Watch List Github Repo | Project 11: Awesome Checklist Checklist Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Created a website for Project 10: Must-Watch Must-Watch List Created and completed Github Repo | Project 11: Awesome Checklist Checklist Thoughts and Emotions: Project 10 and 11 are similar to Project 9. The most time consuming part was to search GitHub, and to found the repos. There are 100 pages on GitHub about checklists. I used at least 5 hours to finish 100 pages. The process was boring. I am satisfied with Project 11. I will add styles after learning website design. Tomorrow’s plan Study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge) Project portolio Change project status Add new projects Github Repo | Project 4: the Local Weather Start JavaScript part Day 20: 2017-12-28Link: Github Repo | Project 4: the Local Weather Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): I finished all items on todo list designed the day before yesterday in one hour. Thoughts and Emotions: I did not use JavaScript for several days because I studied Data Visualization and did personal projects. Hard recall can lead to better memorization after several days. I am discouraged by the websites on my wishlist. They seem complicated. A lot of decisions should be made. Example: Which Front-End framework should be used? Static website or dynamic website? If I choose dynamic websites, which Back-End framework should I use? Where to save the photos? Photos and the website will be saved in different locations. If I choose static websites Which git website to use, GitLab or BitBucket? which deploy website should I use? In addition, I have to wait until I learn Back-End knowledge. Filling mind with undecided stuff is not a comfortable experience. Besides, even if I did projects for several days, they were not FreeCodeCamp project and then I need more willpower to initiate today’s work. Tomorrow’s plan Study tutorial for 1 hour (not count towards the challenge) Github Repo | Project 4: the Local Weather Obtain data from weather API Add CSS id so that the weather info will be added Connect data with HTML codes Future plan Github Repo | Project 4: the Local Weather Add a function to transform between F and C Add button in home page to change between F and C Connect the function and the button Look for images of each weather condition Add codes to show different weather picture based on weather condition]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[The supporting project is 100 Days Of Code Round 1 (R, data analysis) Main Commitment: I will read paper for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days. Start Date: 2017-12-18 Reference: How to effectively scope your software projects from planning to execution Rules I will read paper for at least an hour every day. I will tweet my progress every day, with the hashtag #100DaysOfReadingPaper and note which day of the challenge I’m on. I will track my progress here and push to GitHub. If I read as part of my job, I will count that time towards the challenge. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days. Some important additional considerations Don’t skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks. Template for Log123456### Day : **Paper: []()****Today&apos;s Progress (achievements and frustrations)**: **Thoughts and Emotions** Milestones 1 Day (Day 1: 2017-12-18 Monday ) 7 Days 30 Days 60 Days 90 Days 100 Days LOGDay 1: 2017-12-18 MondayPaper: Adaptive design methods in clinical trials – a review Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Started reading paper: Adaptive design methods in clinical trials – a review Created powerpoint to represent the paper in tomorrow’s seminar Thoughts and Emotions I delayed this challenge for at least two weeks. 😭 It was my initial motivation to start 100 Days Challenge. Because of procrastination, I started other 3 challenges 😂 100 Days Of Code: Web Development 100 Days Of Code: Data Analysis with R 100 Days Of Japanese And restarted writing in this blog which was abandoned in 2014. Three years have passed. Time flies! During three year, I posted only two posts this February. Thank you for 100 Days Challenge project. I found the way to use the blog with joy. Writing blog posts were suffering, but it is fun to use it to track progress. I add new contents every day even if no new posts are created except 4 posts about challenges. Besides, it helps me practice English writing (I am Chinese). Back to paper, it is a pain to read paper. However, I found myself enjoy creating powerpoints. Better, I copied the small section of paper into note part of slides then read it. This decreases stress to read a paper over 10 pages.]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[It is a correct choice to buy Mac Pro!]]></title>
    <url>%2Fits-a-correct-choice-to-buy-mac-pro%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[I usually saw some tutorials in youtube about how to use softwares. There is a high probability that people in the video used Mac to teach how to program. In the past, I feel doubt that why it happened. Last year, in the thanksgiving’s shopping season ($150 off), I decided to buy 13 inch, not too big and heavy, not too small. In the store, it was easy for me to confuse which one to buy, Mac Pro or Mac Air. The employee in the NYU Mac store said price performance ratio was better. She recommended that it was better to buy Mac Air if Mac was my secondary computer. Finally, I made the decision to buy Mac Pro 13 inch because its CPU was better than Mac Air and storage was bigger. Last week, my experience told me that it is one of the most valuable items purchased last year. I did one problem about kernel smoothing method and used guassian kernel. The training data set was big with over 7000 observations and 56 predictors. All the predictors had to be used to generate guassian kernals for each observation in test data. Then I programmed the process to create guassian kernals. For each test data, it took about 3 minutes to generate the wights. I felt it was too slow then run the same program in Lenovo Thinkpad T420. It cost third times time. One of my classmates used Mac Air to program, she could not know when the program would stop but the same program was run in Mac Pro in several seconds. Big difference! A computer with faster CPU is very important. It recalled me the time last semester. A lot of programming were required for bayesian class. Some programs were slow. If I used Mac Pro at that time, less time would be put in my homework and I did not need to stay up every week!]]></content>

    <url>%2FHow-long-to-write-a-book%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[How long to write a book? No correct answer to this question. My sensibility always admire people who can write the book as quickly as possible because the speed implies that they have high productivity and other abilities. My intellects know my sensibility is wrong. How to marry intellects and sensibility? I do not have answer to this question, either. One thing can be confirmed that good books take time. How long? Several years. Eric Novik planned to write a book recently, 8 chapter and over 300 pages. He asked Prof. Gelman: The work seems overwhelming. I always wondered how you manage to produce such high volume of high quality content. What’s the secret?Prof. Gelman replied in his blog:The first secret is, I wouldn’t try to write a book in 6 to 8 months. The first edition of Bayesian Data Analysis took several years. Each new edition took awhile too. So if “long and arduous” to you means “6 to 8 months,” I think your time management skills are already much better than mine!]]></content>
