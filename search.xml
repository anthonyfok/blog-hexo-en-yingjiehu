    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Main Commitment: I will read books about Python at least 30 minutes per day for the next 100 days. Start Date: 2018-01-12 Rules I will read books about Python at least 30 minutes every day. I will tweet my progress every day, with the hashtag #100DaysOfReading #100DaysOfX #python #DataScience and note which day of the challenge I’m on. I will track my progress here and push to GitHub. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days. I will encourage and support at least two people each day in the #100DaysOfReading challenge on Twitter. I can read at most 5 tweets about #100DaysOfReading each day. Less is more. Don’t spend more than enough time on the social networking website. 3 Options Like tweets Leave a comment (optional) Looking at their projects and giving them feedback (no more than 10 minutes per day) Some important additional considerations Don’t skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks. MotivationsI had read some programming books in the past. At that time, I input the knowledge into Anki and hoped that I could remember it in the future. My goal of reading books changes. I made some big tables and input syntax of all programming languages into the tables. There are some other programming languages in it, such as Python and JavaScript. I will not memorize any syntax anymore. Every time I want to use something, the tables are the first place to check. Besides, it is convenient to compare different languages. It is tough to memorize syntax if multiple programming languages are used in the same period. For example, all languages have boolean, the most basic variable type. There are two values, true or false. Python: True, False R: TRUE, FALSE JavaScript: true, false You can get it. There are 3 ways to present boolean. My brain is reluctant to memorize which language uses which method. Other examples: How to define a function? Whether variables should be declared before usage? Whether variables types should be written when we create variables Whether there is a keyword to declare a variable? and more If you can memorize details of all programming languages you have learned, you are genius in my eyes. Books Automate the Boring Stuff with Python: Practical Programming for Total Beginners Milestone 1 Day: 2018-01-12 Friday 7 Days 30 Days 60 Days 90 Days 100 Days Template for Log1234567891011### Day :**Book**: []()**Today&apos;s Progress (achievements and frustrations)**:**Thoughts and Emotions****Tomorrow&apos;s plan**&lt;hr&gt; LOGDay 1: 2018-01-12 FridayBook: Automate the Boring Stuff with Python: Practical Programming for Total Beginners Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Finished Chapter 1 + exercise Thoughts and Emotions It is more pleasant to read Python books than R books. Because Python books follow the structure of most other programming languages, such as Java, C, and C++. The benefit is that I can read more quickly than R books. Tomorrow’s plan Read Chapter 2 Day 2: 2018-01-14 SundayBook: Automate the Boring Stuff with Python: Practical Programming for Total Beginners Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Finished Chapter 2 + exercise Thoughts and Emotions I used 30 minutes to scan Chapter 2. Tomorrow’s plan Read Chapter 3 Day 3: 2018-01-16 TuesdayBook: Automate the Boring Stuff with Python: Practical Programming for Total Beginners Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Finished Chapter 3 + exercise Thoughts and Emotions Reading can be finished within 30 minutes. There are more needed for exercise. Tomorrow’s plan Read Chapter 4 Day 4: 2018-01-17 WednesdayBook: [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python: Practical Programming for Total Beginners Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Part of Chapter 4 Thoughts and Emotions Chapter 4 teaches lists. It slows me down. Lists, tuples, and sets are 3 Python data types which can contain multiple values. The concept will be confusing every time I do not use it for a while. Also, different languages have similar data types like these. Each language has different functions/properties to achieve same basic operations. For example: concatenate two lists Python 1234l1 = [1, 2]l2 = [3]l1 + l2 R 1234l1 = list(1, 2)l2 = list(3)c(l1, l2) JavaScript 1234var l1 = [1, 2]var l2 = [3]l1.concat(l2) After one day, can you remember which language uses which syntax? Tomorrow’s plan Read Chapter 4]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Main Commitment: I will code to make R package for at least 30 minutes every day for the next 100 days. Start Date: 2018-01-12 A companion project to 100 Days of Reading Paper. Rules I will code to make R package for at least 30 minutes every day for the next 100 days. I will track my progress here and push to GitHub. I will only count the days where I spend at least some of my time building projects — not the days where I spend all my coding time working through lessons and tutorials. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days. Some important additional considerations Don’t skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks.

These happen to all packages made by RStudio. People in my field care less about presentations. I felt frustrated in the past. Statisticians complain machine learning people taking more credits for data analysis work. Appearance is important. If machine learning field produces better websites than statistics, I will go for machine learning. I feel lucky that FreeCodeCamp helped me learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It is doable to customize part of the style. Thanks to having learned JavaScript. I can customize the footer with jQuery. pkgdown package does not supply a way to customize footer with templates because the author said he might reconstruct the whole package later!!!! It upsets me. Tomorrow’s plan Write documentation for the toy package Day 2: 2018-01-14 SundayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Decide the name of the new package Read others’ packages Thoughts and Emotions I worked one hour for the project today since I thought my rule was one hour instead of 30 minutes. It is hard to understand other people’s code because there are so many functions I do not know. It is like reading an English article (My native language is Chinese) full of words I don’t know. It is discouraging. Future’s plan]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[100 Days Of Helping Students in Udacity Forum [Dumped]]]></title>
    <url>%2F100-Days-Of-Helping-Students-in-Udacity-Forum%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Main Commitment: I will answer at least 5 questions in Udacity forum for Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship every day. (web development track) Start Date: 2018-01-11 BackgroundI received the acceptance letter of Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship (web development track), Phase I. The scholarship has two phases. The criteria to be selected for Phase II: Complete the course before April 11 Be Active in the Udacity forum or slack I will be committed to completing the course. However, I cannot be active in the forum or any social media channel for a long time because of introversion. I got the following information on #AMA of slack. Q: How are you keeping track of our Slack usage in regards to moving on to the second scholarship? I know you can track our forum posts, but not sure how you can accurately measure Slack usage? A: We’ll be focusing on quality of your contributions and looking for leadership in the community. To be clear, leadership doesn’t just mean being the expert and answering questions. It also means taking the plunge as a beginner, putting yourself out here in the community, and really embracing this as an opportunity to learn and get support. We see that as leadership as well! In terms of Slack, we’re in here every single day participating with you for the next 3 months. We’ll be tracking participation and leadership through a variety of metrics. I hate the idea of “leadership”. I don’t want to be led by anyone. I will be responsible for my own study. How to thrive as an introvert in an extroverted work environment? My solution is to at least answer 5 questions in the forum every day and to record the progress here, then close the browser for the rest of the day. I tend to overdo things. The restriction helps me not consume more energy and time than needed in the social networking websites. We will see people learn faster when reading the forum. It will increase pressure. If we read the forum every day for a long time, the pressure will accumulate little by little until defeating us. Restricting the access to the forum will keep the stress level to be manageable. If I finish the course, complete the challenge, and do not receive the Phase II scholarship in the end, I will not blame myself for not working harder. Updates: Projects will not be graded. But this is my goal of learning. I am considering whether I should work hard for round 2. Rules I will answer at least 5 questions in Udacity forum for Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship. (web development track) every day I will track my progress here and push to GitHub. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days. The most important goal is to complete the course. Less is more. Don’t spend more than enough time on the social networking website (forum, slack, and Twitter). Some important additional considerations Don’t skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks. Milestones 1 Day: 2018-01-11 Thursday 7 Days 30 Days 60 Days 90 Days 100 Days Template for Log1234567891011121314151617### Day :**Link**: [Post]()**Today&apos;s Progress (achievements and frustrations)**:1.2.3.4.5.**Thoughts and Emotions:****Tomorrow&apos;s plan**&lt;hr&gt; LOGDay 1: 2018-01-11 ThursdayLink: Post Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Q: feedback on Project Mockup to Article * &lt;https://codepen.io/moshiko88s/pen/zpjWey?editors=1000&gt; * &lt;https://codepen.io/elicedx/pen/Qarrjm&gt; A: Both of your projects look great. Q: Hi everyone, this is probably a silly question but when I type&lt; button&gt; Click Me! &lt; /button&gt; (I did it without spaces and it worked for my quiz but not on the browser, I just don’t know how to paste as plain text here. Sorry!) into my browser it does not actually show me a button. I feel like I am missing something in the beginning but I don’t know what it is. Can anyone help? A: How about using different browsers? It is good to install multiple browsers on the computer. Then you will know which one has the error, code or browser specific3.4.5. Thoughts and Emotions: Tomorrow’s plan DumpedThis is the first 100-Day challenge I gave up. The expected time to be spent on the Udacity forum and slack will be enormous to be enrolled in the Round 2 scholarship. I dislike spending time this way. It means I give up pursing Round 2 scholarship. Thanks to my roommate. She helped me make the decision. It is tough to give up.]]></content>

Tomorrow’s plan Read Chapter 1 Day 2: 2018-01-10 WednesdayBook: my R notes Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): 30 minutes Review R notes taken in the past Thoughts and Emotions My book is not beside me. I reviewed R notes taken in the past to continue the challenge. I am happy to do that. Some old notes were deleted I input notes to the large programming language sheet. Statistical analysis programming languages have some unique data type that other languages do not have. For example, R has a vector data type. Elements in a vector have the same atomic data type, such as string or integer. Python has a list while JavaScript has an array. Both of them can create a vector of data, but their elements can be a mix of string and integer. A more specific example: JavaScript: var ourArray = [&quot;John&quot;, 23]; Python: things = [“shoes”, 85, 8.8, “ball”] R converts a vector of a mix of string and integer into a vector of string automatically. 123456&gt; ourArray = c(23, "John")&gt; ourArray[1] "23" "John"&gt; things = c("shoes", 85, 8.8, "balls")&gt; things[1] "shoes" "85" "8.8" "balls" Tomorrow’s plan Read Chapter 1 Day 3: 2018-01-11 ThursdayBook: Using R and RStudio for Data Management, Statistical Analysis, and Graphics (second edition) Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Chapter 1: page 1-6 Thoughts and Emotions The book is like a dictionary but is worse than a dictionary.

    <url>%2F100-Days-Of-Practicing-Makeup-Round-1%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Main Commitment: I will practice makeup. Start Date: 2017-12-31 This is a very personal project. Making up is a required skill for women. I thought it was a waste of time and worried about the harmful integridents in makeups. Despite my negative emotion towards makeup, I have to think about one method to push myself to learn it. This is the inspiration of the challenge. “100 Days of Challenge” can be extended to any skill that you do not enjoy but is required to be learned. Rules I will try to practice makeup once per day. I will track my progress here and push to GitHub. Watching makeup tutorials will not count towards the challenge. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days. Some important additional considerations Don’t skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks. Milestones 1 Day (Day 1: 2017-12-31 Sunday) 7 Days (Day 7: 2018-01-11 Thursday) 30 Days 60 Days 90 Days 100 Days Template for Log123456789### Day :**Today&apos;s Progress (achievements and frustrations)**:**Thoughts and Emotions:****Tomorrow&apos;s plan**&lt;hr&gt; Reference Tutorials Makeup for acne skin (Chinese) LOGDay 1: 2017-12-31 SundayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Practice based on Makeup for acne skin (Chinese) My skin color is darker than the host and I have dark circles. The eye color she used does not have an effect on my skin. Thoughts and Emotions: I like the tutorial Makeup for acne skin (Chinese) very much. Because it is suitable for acne skin. Most of the hosts have good skin (or they adjust color) and do not emphasize on how to conceal red spots. My roommate said the foundation is much lighter than my skin. I will try different foundation tomorrow. Tomorrow’s plan Try a different foundation Day 2: 2018-01-01 MondayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): I made up before going out. Thoughts and Emotions: I applied both the new foundation and old foundation. I looked whiter. Tomorrow, the only new foundation will be used. Tomorrow’s plan Use the new foundation only Day 3: 2018-01-02 TuesdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): I used the foundation stick only. It does not cover dark spot well. Thoughts and Emotions: I am not sure whether the foundation stick not well or my technique is not good. I got the foundation sticks from Clinique’s Black Friday sales one month ago. There is no foundation stick from other brand as a control group. Tomorrow’s plan Concealer with liquid lighter foundation + Foundation Stick Day 4: 2018-01-03 WednesdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Makeup before going to work. This is the first time I did it. Thoughts and Emotions: Forget about how much time would be spent time on makeup. Just do it. Then I did it. Little liquid foundation cannot cover dark spot. I think it is ok to have dark spot which makes me look not fake. I fogot applying the concealer which is close to my skin color. Tomorrow’s plan Don’t forget to apply the concealer which is close to my skin color. Day 5: 2018-01-08 MondayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Applied makeup before going to the department Thoughts and Emotions: I missed 4 days in a row. On Wednesday, I did not have time for makeup in the morning. Then the next few days, I chose to stay at home, and the motivation to makeup was near 0. I am happy to resume the challenge. Tomorrow’s plan No plan. If I continue to do it tomorrow, it will be great. Day 6: 2018-01-10 WednesdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Applied makeup around 3:30 p.m. Thoughts and Emotions: My lamp color is yellow. I cannot see the true effect from the mirrow if I makeup at night. The sky becomes darker around 3:30 p.m.. It motivated to makeup today. Day 7: 2018-01-11 ThursdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Applied makeup around 3 p.m. Thoughts and Emotions: After reading tutorials on Udacity (Grow with Google Challenge scholarship), I used makeup as a rest. Then I will do excercise on Udacity. Day 8: 2018-01-12 FridayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Applied makeup around 3 p.m. Thoughts and Emotions: I did not want to do makeup. I used the CBT method to push me to do it. Future plan]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Japanese Class Weekly Paragraph]]></title>
    <url>%2FJapanese-Class-Weekly-Paragraph%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Our Japanese teacher asked us to talk about what we did last week as an oral exercise. It starts with one student asking another “週末は何をしましたか”。 The answer requires at least three sentences. We use the sentence structures taught and look up new words if necessary. The paragraphs here were what I prepared for each class. It can be a good record to show learning progress. I write Chinese sentences first, then translate them into Japanese. Chinese version below is very rough. It contains ideas more than the Japanese version. You can freely skip Chinese and read Japanese only.

    <title><![CDATA[100 Days Of Behavioral Activation for Depression (Round 1)]]></title>
    <url>%2F100-Days-of-Behavioral-Activation-for-Depression-Round-1%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Main Commitment: I will decide to do/not to do things based on behavioral activation for depression. Start Date: 2017-12-12 The goal is to be in control. The challenge is very personal and very important for me. I asked several therapists before about whether I had depression or not and none of them gave me a direct answer. Finally, a therapist who uses CBT told me that I had depression and my symptom was typical. I felt relieved and can focus on how to treat depression. When I did not get confirmed the answer, I felt frustrated and did not know the goal of the therapy and the criteria for recovery. The method was taught by the CBT therapist. The goal is to be in control. Before I decide to do/do not do things, I will ask myself whether they will increase depression after doing them. If they decrease depression or keep the depression level the same with before, they can be done. The method is easily incorporated into my thinking style but it is not a habit. The goal of making the challenge is to make it a habit. Changing thinking style is very different from skills like coding, drawing, reading paper. Then the rules will be different. Rules I will try to use it when I make decision on the project level. I will track my progress here and push to GitHub. Whether I use it or not, I must record here. Milestones 1 Day 1 (2017-12-12 Tuesday) 7 Days (2018-01-04 Thursday) 30 Days 60 Days 90 Days 100 Days Template for Log123456789### Day :**Time, Events, Thoughts and Emotions:*** Morning* Afternoon* Evening&lt;hr&gt; LogDay 1: 2017-12-12 Tuesday Afternoon open mailbox deal with letters activate 2 cards pay utility bill write today’s CBT session notes Evening bath face scrub face mask Day 2: 2017-12-13 Wednesday Morning have lunch Afternoon work web development project for only one hour Evening recite Japanese words on Anki Day 3: 2017-12-14 Thursday Morning study web develpmenent tutorials for only one hour Day 4: 2018-01-01 MondayI resumed recording anti-depressant behavior activation for depression. Though the method is close to my thinking style, I do not use it automatically so far. I want to develope this skill. Morning: When I lay on the bed this morning, getting up became a difficult thing. I told myself I would regret. Afternoon: I did not use the anti-depressant behavior activation as a rule to do things. I did recall my action of lying on the bed and thought about the it. Evening: The same with afternoon. Now it is 9 p.m.. I want to relax and told myself I would increase depression tomorrow if I did it. Day 5: 2018-01-02 Tuesday Rewrote the post to fit 100 Days of Chanllenge style. Time, Events, Thoughts and Emotions: Morning The same with yesterday. The temperature was cold and I did not want to get up. Even if I used the method, the anti-dpressant behavior activation does not help. I used the remote to open my small heater. I got up even if I knew it was still cold outside and the heater would not warm the whole room. Afternoon Around 3:40 p.m., I felt anxious and wanted to open music as a background noise. I told myself it would increase depression if I did that. Then I opened the Markdown file of the challenge and started writing introduction, rules, and goals, and formatting the challenge. Evening Bath Mask Day 6: 2018-01-03 WednesdayTime, Events, Thoughts and Emotions: Morning I haven’t been to the office for two weeks. If I do not go to the office, it will increase depression If I go to the office, not doing data analysis will increase depression. The conclusion: whether I go to the office or not will increase depression 😢 Outcome: I chose a different walking path to the office. Depression hit me several times during walking. Because the roads are not clean or organized. I did one-hour data analysis. My emotion is ok. Working long hours will increase depression. Afternoon I brought KitKat to the office. If I eat KitKat as lunch, depression will increase. Evening I did not use the technique. All activities at night have been done for several days. I can activate them without much willpower. Day 7: 2018-01-04 ThursdayTime, Events, Thoughts and Emotions: Morning: The therapist’s assistant left a voice mail to me at 8 a.m. and cancelled the today’s session. I did not listen to it until the subway started. The chain on the left boot was broken. I decided to return home and go to Macy’s to buy one pair. After one hour, I felt depression and wanted to go home. But there was one mall left. I asked myself whether I felt bad about myself if I skipped the mall. The answer was yes. Even if I did not feel happy, I pushed myself to do it. Afternoon Depression remained in the afternoon. I was working on freecodecamp 100 days challenge of coding accompanied by depression. Occasionally I asked my roommates which graph she like. It improved my mood. Evening I used the whole night to read Hugo tutorials and started to make a Hugo theme. I did not finish some 100-day challenges and had mixed feeling. On the one hand, solving one of the most concerned technology problems I have recently gave me joy. On the other hand, not doing 100-day challenges increased the stress level. Day 8: 2018-01-05 FridayTime, Events, Thoughts and Emotions: Morning Lying in bed. I decided to make a website about projects for beginners even if I know that not doing 100-day challenges would increase the stress level. But if I proposponed making the website, the stress level would increased, too. I cannot forget the ideas. There is no solution for the situation. Afternoon I thought of Behavioral Activation for Depression, but no decision was decided based on it. Evening I thought about it intensely when I bathed. I have several things that I am reluctant to do. If I do not do them, then depression ≥will increase. If I order the tasks on to-do lists from the least resistance to the highest resistance, then I do it in reverse order. Will it a good method to solve the situation? Day 9: 2018-01-06 SaturdayTime, Events, Thoughts and Emotions: Morning Lying in bed to use iPad to search online. Even if I regret, the ideas/contents I searched online remain in my mind if I did not do that. Afternoon I started to implement ideas from yesterday’s night. I listed todos from I want to do most to least willing to do. Then the items were reversed by order. I started to do from the top. I procrastinated to start doing until 5 p.m.. If I start from the items I enjoy most, I will start around noon. After doing them, I enjoyed the process and worried about the slow progress. Evening I am happy I made small toy examples. When considering there are more things needed to be done, I stressed out. Behavioral Activation for Depression does not help in the situation. Day 10: 2018-01-07 SundayTime, Events, Thoughts and Emotions: Morning I searched some stuff lying in bed. Afternoon I did not use the method. Evening I pushed myself to do challenge. Day 11: 2018-01-08 MondayTime, Events, Thoughts and Emotions: Morning It happens. Afternoon It does not happen. Evening I planned to write codes for one hour. But I overdid it and spent 3 hours. I went to sleep after 3 a.m.. I should not continue to do it even if the projects gave me fulfillment at that time. 福祸相依. Blessings and misfortunes are next-door neighbors. Day 12: 2018-01-09 TuesdayTime, Events, Thoughts and Emotions: Morning regret and stress Afternoon I did the projects in my mind. But I still feel stressful. Evening I pushed myself to be on track of doing challenges. Otherwise I will feel bad tomorrow. I spent several minutes on watching music. Even if I enjoyed the process, I regretted. Day 13: 2018-01-10 WednesdayTime, Events, Thoughts and Emotions: Morning Getting up Thinking “if I do not get up, it will increase depression” does not help me get up but increase stress. If I think the most next action of getting up, it works. Afternoon I did not use the technique but wrote the notes for the morning Evening I planned to make a project related 100 days of challenge. I did not feel good about it. Every time I thought of it, the stress increased. I finally decided to give up. This is an extremely good decision. Day 14: 2018-01-11 ThursdayTime, Events, Thoughts and Emotions: Morning Yeserday I was too excited to get Grow with Google Challenge scholarship. I slept more than usual. Afternoon My roommate helps me made the decision. I do not like to be judged based on how active I am in the forum. But it is the onlhy way to get Google round 2 scholarship. If I push myself to reply at least 5 posts everyday, it will increase my stress and depression level every day. It is hard to give up, but I did it. Evening Record Day 15: 2018-01-12 FridayTime, Events, Thoughts and Emotions: Morning get up Afternoon Made decision I worked on Udacity tutorial for only one hour. I use willpower to convince myself that I should not compare with other students. Some students start to do the 11th section, almost end of the Udacity course. Their fast progress give me a lot of pressure. I won’t be happy if I spend the whole day to learn one tutorial. makeup I did not want to do makeup. I used the method to push me to do it. Evening I overdid programming for R package. I planned one hour. It’s over two hours. The method stopped me. Day 16: 2018-01-13 SaturdayTime, Events, Thoughts and Emotions: Morning I did not wake up until 11 a.m.. There is no morning Afternoon Even though I knew that grocery shopping would disrupt the rhythm of my life, I had to do it because soical interaction took time. Evening I started 100-day challenge around 10 p.m.. I forgave myself for being late and just began to do it. Day 17: 2018-01-14 SundayTime, Events, Thoughts and Emotions: Morning nothing Afternoon I did not need this technique to start working on 100-day challenge. But thanks for it to help me at the beginning. Evening I regretted watching Zhihu and musci MV, and ate chocolates. Day 18: 2018-01-15 MondayTime, Events, Thoughts and Emotions: Morning nothing Afternoon Just do it. Evening Crashed because of pressure. I do not feel happy even if I finished the course provided by Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship. Day 19: 2018-01-16 TuesdayTime, Events, Thoughts and Emotions: Morning Did data analysis until 4 a.m. Afternoon If there is no timer to work for one hour per subject. Recalling the past made me feel I was wasting time at that time. Evening I noticed my doing things slow because I am absorbed in my mind. I did not use the technique but started doing one of the challenges. I wanted me to do more because I will decrease the pressure when I recall today’s life.]]></content>

    <url>%2F100-Days-Of-Code-R-data-analysis-Round-1%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Main Commitment: I will code to do data analysis for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days. Start Date: 2017-12-11 A companion project to 100 Days of Reading Paper. RulesModification (2018-01-05): I found The 5-Day Data Challenge in Kaggle today . I like Data Challenge better than Data Analysis with R. The title of the post was changed from 100 Days Of Code: Data Analysis with R (Round 1) to 100 Days Of Data Challenge (Round 1). Even though no one tweets #100daysOfData, I want to use it. I will code using R or do data analysis with other software (such as Python) for at least an hour every day. Projects are counted towards the challenge: statistical analysis projects in my work projects from dissertation competitions, such as Kaggle Activties are counted towards the challenge: understand datasets in excel import data into R clean data write codes to do exploratory analysis and apply statistical model write statistical reports Activities are not counted towards the challnege: write emails to clients meet with clients/supervisors I will tweet my progress every day, with the hashtag #100DaysOfCode, #100daysOfData and #100DaysOfDataScience and note which day of the challenge I’m on. I will encourage and support at least two people each day in the #100DaysOfDataScience challenge on Twitter. I can read at most 5 tweets about #100DaysOfDataScience every day. Less is more. Don’t spend more than enough time on the social networking website. 3 Options Like tweets Leave a comment (optional) Looking at their projects and giving them feedback (no more than 10 minutes per day) I will track my progress here and push to GitHub. I will only count the days where I spend at least some of my time building projects — not the days where I spend all my coding time working through lessons and tutorials. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days. Some important additional considerations Don’t skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks. Template for Log1234567891011### Day : **Link**: [Github Repo]() | [Project :]()**Today&apos;s Progress (achievements and frustrations)**: **Thoughts and Emotions****Tomorrow&apos;s plan**&lt;hr&gt; LOGDay 1: 2017-12-17 SundayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): import data into R Thoughts and Emotions The column name is messy after the data was imported into R. Thinking of the idea that I have to rename all columns one by one, I feel scared. Today I learned parts of tidyverse package in Lynda.com. I thought it was a good package. When I start using it, I missed the old method. But when I saw base R converted all character variables into factor variable after import, I missed tidyverse. I had mixed feelings about both base R and tidyverse. Day 2: 2018-01-03 WednesdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): One hour work Cleaned the dataset column by column Wrote a Markdown table to record Thoughts and Emotions I did not finish the cleaning. I know cleaning is faster if I use SAS. I know the one hour work is not productive. But it gave me less pressure. I set a one-clock timer. I can feel that when it was approaching one hour, the stress level increased. Every time I work long hour until burning out, it will make it harder to start work next time. My goal is not the speed or productivity but consistency. Tomorrow’s plan Clean data Make descriptive data of variables left in the cleaned data Write report Run simple logistic analysis of batch effect and Reasons Day 3: 2018-01-05 FridayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): I created a R package project for beginners on RSnippets.com. It is to build a utility package for personal usage. I started to make one. Thoughts and Emotions I did not do this challenge again. The small project can get me started. This is the reason I did a project for beginners, not a big project. I feel good at the end of one-hour session. Tomorrow’s plan Clean data Make descriptive data of variables left in the cleaned data Write report Run simple logistic analysis of batch effect and Reasons Day 4: 2018-01-06 SaturdayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Read the post about how changing location will affect the linear regression result. Reproduce the example from Sean I created 2 toy examples: $y = 0.2x$ $y = 0.2x+x^2$ $x$ is uniform(-0.5,0.5). $x$ in the program means uniform(0,1). If the true model is linear The above graph shows fitted models look almost the same when the location of $x$ is changed. The above graph shows the intercept will decrease when the location of $x$ becomes bigger. This conforms to the mathematical proof. $$y = 0.2x = (0.2-0.2a) + (x+0.2a)$$ $0.2-0.2a$ is the intercepts after $x$ moves. It has the linear relationship with $a$. However, in theory, the coefficient of $x$ remains the same. In fact, it changes a little bit. If the true model is non-linear The above two graphs show that the location has big impact on cofficients for non-linear models. Around 800 and -800, lm fails to estimate a coefficient for the quadratic term, &amp; gives a warning about a singular design matrix. The relationship between intercept and location is not linear anymore. In summary, if the scale of predictors is big, such as over 800, it is a good choice to center them first before performing any data analysis.

I feel bad that they were supposed to take less time. Tomorrow’s plan Read online posts about normalized data Make descriptive data of variables left in the cleaned data Write report Run simple logistic analysis of batch effect and Reasons Day 5: 2018-01-15 MondayToday’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Data analysis for over 3 hours. Thoughts and Emotions The most accomplished thing is to find how to reduce variables required to be created or reduce the number of global variables. When fitting each model, I have to create intermediate variables, such as a variable fit to keep the information of fitted models. Every time, I have to think hard to give each variable a different name, or make sure I run all code if the same variable names are reused. The intermediate variables are all global variables. It is the user’s responsibility to delete unused variables. It is worse that variables like i or j created at the beginning of the loop are not temporary variables! Now I found a solution: use with function. Let me use iris dataset as an example. By the way, iris is a global variable name for the dataset. Very bad practice. 12345678&gt; head(iris) Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species1 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa2 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 setosa3 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa4 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa5 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa6 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 setosa For example, I want to fit two logistic models. They include different independent variables. Model 1 uses length and width while Model 2 uses width only. 1234567891011121314# Model 1fit &lt;- glm(Species ~ Sepal.Length + Sepal.Width, family=binomial(link='logit'), data = iris, control = list(maxit = 50))summary(fit)# Model 2fit &lt;- glm(Species ~ Sepal.Width, family=binomial(link='logit'), data = iris, control = list(maxit = 50))summary(fit) Two models used the same variable to fit to save the information from glm. fit is a global variable. In fact, fit is an intermediate variable and is not useful at the end of data analysis. This is also the reason to reuse it in a different model. It is a poor coding style. I have several choices. Use a different name for fit for different models. Usually, I will fit a lot of models during data analysis. Keeping track of the model fit requires patience. Set fit as a local variable in a function Write a function for each model? The same problem exists as above: keeping track of the function requires patience. Set fit as a local variable within with function. My choice. Let me rewrite the code. with(iris, { fit &lt;- glm(Species ~ Sepal.Length + Sepal.Width, family=binomial(link='logit'), data = iris, control = list(maxit = 50)) print(summary(fit)) } ) with(iris, { fit &lt;- glm(Species ~ Sepal.Width, family=binomial(link='logit'), data = iris, control = list(maxit = 50)) print(summary(fit)) }) The fit variable in each with function will not affect each other. It will disappear when with ends. Excellent! Tomorrow’s plan Meeting Refine Future’s plan Read source code of Relaxed Lasso’s R package]]></content>

    <url>%2F100-Days-Of-Japanese-Round-1%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Main Commitment: I will recite Japanese words with Anki to increase Japanese vocabulary. Start Date: 2017-12-10 BackgroundI learned Japanese once per week for one semester at a night school around 10 years ago in China. I started learning Japanese this July. One day my friend asked me out to have lunch. During the meal, she said her Japanese first class of a session would begin at night. I was curious about how Americans learned Japanese, then audited the class. I was impressed by the teacher’s experience. Her native language is Chinese, the same with me. She had been lived in Japanese for 10 years and spoke English so fluently that American employees in the night school did not recognize that she was a foreigner. She is a talented and easy-going person. I enjoyed the class and decided to register one session. Each session has 10 classes, one class per week. I already finished one session with her and currently am taking the second session. Since August, I have been using Anki to recite Japanese words. Hence, the 100-day challenge should be easy for me. Rules I will review at least 100 Japanese cards in Anki every day. The words are from Genki books and core 10k words. One word has more than 5 cards. One hundred cards are not equal to 100 unique words. I will tweet my progress every day, with the hashtag #100DaysOfJapanese and note which day of the challenge I’m on. I will encourage and support at least two people each day in the #Anki #Japanese challenge on Twitter. I can read at most 5 tweets about #Anki #Japanese each day. Less is more. Don’t spend more than enough time on the social networking website. 3 Options Like tweets Leave a comment I will track my progress here and push to GitHub. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days. Some important additional considerations Don’t skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks. Milestones 1 Day (Day 1: 2017-12-10 Sunday) 7 Days (Day 7: 2017-12-16 Saturday) 30 Days 60 Days 90 Days 100 Days Template for Log12345678### Day :**No. of Anki Cards**:**Time spent**:**Thoughts and Emotions:**&lt;hr&gt; LogDay 1: 2017-12-10 SundayNo. of Anki Cards: 292 Time spent: 34 minutes Thoughts and Emotions: I cannot concentrate on review Anki cards. A probable reason is a worry about whether I can get positive feedback. There are only 4 tweets under #100DaysOfJapanese. Too few people. Then I searched weibo, which is Chinese version counterpart of Twitter. People there either posted a picture to show their completion without showing process or stopped within 30 days. It is a little bit discouraging. I am not sure whether I should incorporate social media during the challenge. Day 2: 2017-12-11 MondayNo. of Anki Cards: 313 Time spent: 36 minutes Thoughts and Emotions: I am happy that I found the community in the twitter. #100DaysOfJapanese is not a right hashtag. People use #Anki #Japanese to indicate they use Anki to learn Japanese. Day 3: 2017-12-12 TuesdayNo. of Anki Cards: 525 Time spent: 62 minutes Thoughts and Emotions: There are over 600 cards in the backlog. In recent days, I focus on reviewing old cards; no new cards. Day 4: 2017-12-13 WednesdayNo. of Anki Cards: 886 Time spent: 104 minutes Thoughts and Emotions:I cleared the backlog. What a relief! Tomorrow I can recite new words. Day 5: 2017-12-14 ThursdayNo. of Anki Cards: 576 (100 new cards) Time spent: 72 minutes Thoughts and Emotions: 100 new cards Day 6: 2017-12-15 FridayNo. of Anki Cards: 447 Time spent: 51 minutes Thoughts and Emotions:Unhappy Day 7: 2017-12-16 SaturdayNo. of Anki Cards: 335 Time spent: 40 minutes Thoughts and Emotions:I am stressed out recently. Day 8: 2017-12-18 MondayNo. of Anki Cards: 407 Time spent: 41 minutes Thoughts and Emotions: I skipped yesterday. 😢 But I reviewed faster during commute today. 😊 Day 9: 2017-12-19 TuesdayNo. of Anki Cards: 379 Time spent: 42 minutes Thoughts and Emotions: I am worry about grammar. I should spend more time on it. Day 10: 2017-12-20 WednesdayNo. of Anki Cards: 250 Time spent: 25 minutes Thoughts and Emotions: Reviewing during commuting. Day 11: 2017-12-21 ThursdayNo. of Anki Cards: 120 Time spent: 12 minutes Thoughts and Emotions: I forced myself to review at least 100 cards. Day 12: 2018-01-08 MondayNo. of Anki Cards: 216 Time spent: 21 minutes Thoughts and Emotions: I missed 17 days in a row because my Japanese class was over and motivation disappeared. My friend and I decided to take private Japanese class. Yesterday I said the class could begin next week and my motivation is back 😂 Day 13: 2018-01-13 FridayNo. of Anki Cards: 268 Time spent: 27 minutes Thoughts and Emotions: I have too many challenges to do every day.]]></content>

    <url>%2F100-Days-Of-Reading-Paper-Round-1%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[The supporting project is 100 Days Of Code Round 1 (R, data analysis) Main Commitment: I will read paper for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days. Start Date: 2017-12-18 Reference: How to effectively scope your software projects from planning to execution Rules I will read paper for at least an hour every day. I will tweet my progress every day, with the hashtag #100DaysOfReadingPaper and note which day of the challenge I’m on. I will track my progress here and push to GitHub. If I read as part of my job, I will count that time towards the challenge. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days. Some important additional considerations Don’t skip two days in a row, and try not to skip more than 1 day in 2 weeks. Template for Log12345678910### Day :**Paper: []()****Today&apos;s Progress (achievements and frustrations)**:**Thoughts and Emotions****Tomorrow&apos;s plan**&lt;hr&gt; Milestones 1 Day (Day 1: 2017-12-18 Monday ) 7 Days 30 Days 60 Days 90 Days 100 Days LOGDay 1: 2017-12-18 MondayPaper: Adaptive design methods in clinical trials – a review Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Started reading paper: Adaptive design methods in clinical trials – a review Created powerpoint to represent the paper in tomorrow’s seminar Thoughts and Emotions I delayed this challenge for at least two weeks. 😭 It was my initial motivation to start 100 Days Challenge. Because of procrastination, I started other 3 challenges 😂 100 Days Of Code: Web Development 100 Days Of Code: Data Analysis with R 100 Days Of Japanese And restarted writing in this blog which was abandoned in 2014. Three years have passed. Time flies! During three year, I posted only two posts this February. Thank you for 100 Days Challenge project. I found the way to use the blog with joy. Writing blog posts were suffering, but it is fun to use it to track progress. I add new contents every day even if no new posts are created except 4 posts about challenges. Besides, it helps me practice English writing (I am Chinese). Back to paper, it is a pain to read paper. However, I found myself enjoy creating powerpoints. Better, I copied the small section of paper into note part of slides then read it. This decreases stress to read a paper over 10 pages. Day 2: 2018-01-06Paper: Relaxed Lasso by Nicolai Meinshausen Today’s Progress (achievements and frustrations): Started to read paper again. 😂 Thoughts and Emotions I did an experiment. If I begin to do things that have the highest resistance, will I achieve more? Will the stress level go down? Will I be happier? Reading paper is on the top list. Then I did it. I feel a little bit relief. But I postponed it to 5 p.m., and this means I will achieve less than yesterday. Completing less can increase stress level, too. Is there a balance. Tomorrow’s plan Read “Relaxed Lasso”]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[When updating R on Mac, we can uninstall the old version and install the new version. Uninstalling R is very easy on Mac. During installation of R, at least 2 folders are involved. /Applications/R.app folder: contains GUI /Library/Frameworks/R.framework folder: contains R framework (unkown) /usr/bin : contains some linksWhen uninstalling, R under Mac OS X will delete all of them. Uninstallation steps as follows: open terminal in Mac OS X run rm -rf /Library/Frameworks/R.framework /Applications/R.app \ /usr/bin/R /usr/bin/RscriptDone!

    <title><![CDATA[It is a correct choice to buy Mac Pro!]]></title>
    <url>%2Fits-a-correct-choice-to-buy-mac-pro%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[I usually saw some tutorials in youtube about how to use softwares. There is a high probability that people in the video used Mac to teach how to program. In the past, I feel doubt that why it happened. Last year, in the thanksgiving’s shopping season ($150 off), I decided to buy 13 inch, not too big and heavy, not too small. In the store, it was easy for me to confuse which one to buy, Mac Pro or Mac Air. The employee in the NYU Mac store said price performance ratio was better. She recommended that it was better to buy Mac Air if Mac was my secondary computer. Finally, I made the decision to buy Mac Pro 13 inch because its CPU was better than Mac Air and storage was bigger. Last week, my experience told me that it is one of the most valuable items purchased last year. I did one problem about kernel smoothing method and used guassian kernel. The training data set was big with over 7000 observations and 56 predictors. All the predictors had to be used to generate guassian kernals for each observation in test data. Then I programmed the process to create guassian kernals. For each test data, it took about 3 minutes to generate the wights. I felt it was too slow then run the same program in Lenovo Thinkpad T420. It cost third times time. One of my classmates used Mac Air to program, she could not know when the program would stop but the same program was run in Mac Pro in several seconds. Big difference! A computer with faster CPU is very important. It recalled me the time last semester. A lot of programming were required for bayesian class. Some programs were slow. If I used Mac Pro at that time, less time would be put in my homework and I did not need to stay up every week!]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[How long to write a book?]]></title>
    <url>%2FHow-long-to-write-a-book%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[How long to write a book? No correct answer to this question. My sensibility always admire people who can write the book as quickly as possible because the speed implies that they have high productivity and other abilities. My intellects know my sensibility is wrong. How to marry intellects and sensibility? I do not have answer to this question, either. One thing can be confirmed that good books take time. How long? Several years. Eric Novik planned to write a book recently, 8 chapter and over 300 pages. He asked Prof. Gelman: The work seems overwhelming. I always wondered how you manage to produce such high volume of high quality content. What’s the secret?Prof. Gelman replied in his blog:The first secret is, I wouldn’t try to write a book in 6 to 8 months. The first edition of Bayesian Data Analysis took several years. Each new edition took awhile too. So if “long and arduous” to you means “6 to 8 months,” I think your time management skills are already much better than mine!]]></content>
